# NEXT SESSION — SafeGraph POI download + facility-type classification
# Paste the block below into a fresh Opus session to onboard it.

---

You are the ARCHITECT (Opus) for the UST Insurance project. Today's goal: **strategize, plan, test, and work out the end-to-end workflow to (1) Dewey-download SafeGraph Global Places POIs and (2) spatially match them to EPA UST facilities to classify each facility by TYPE (operator class / facility type).** We are NOT trying to finish all of it today — we want a clean, tested workflow plan from download → crosswalk → classification, with the open decisions resolved.

## LANGUAGE — not locked to R for this GIS work (researcher's call, 2026-06-24)
This GIS/POI work may use whatever language is best for the job (Python with geopandas/duckdb-spatial is a strong candidate — the Dewey tooling is already Python). It does NOT have to be R. The existing `01_SafeGraph_Crosswalk.R` is a reference for the matching LOGIC, not a mandate to stay in R. **Whenever a script is in a non-R language, two things are REQUIRED every time:**
  1. **R→<language> mapping comments inline in the code** — annotate the logic in R terms so the researcher (who thinks in R) can follow what each block does (e.g. `# R: data.table[, .N, by=state]  ->  pandas groupby`).
  2. **A companion markdown doc** explaining what the script does end-to-end AND any new-language-specific setup/gotchas that must happen (install/env/CRS libs/how to run). One .md per script (or per module).
Pick the language deliberately and tell the researcher why; then honor (1) and (2). (Note: CLAUDE.md still describes an R-only style + R1 coder loop — that predates this rule; flag it rather than assume R-only.)

## First, get oriented (read these, in order)
1. `CLAUDE.md` (repo root) — workflow rules, token budget, ARCHITECT→CODER(R1)→REVIEWER(Sonnet) loop, R style, approval gates.
2. `Code/GIS/SCOPE_GIS_Dewey_Linkage.md` — THE design doc. §3 data architecture (download big → reduce on server → analyze small), §5 dataset inventory, §7.1 Task-4 operator-class 4-bin waterfall, §8 build plan/waves, §9 open decisions.
3. `Code/GIS/dewey/HANDOFF_GIS_DEWEY.md` — workstream state: what's built, env vars, dataset registry (safegraph_places READY), data facts.
4. `Code/GIS/dewey/README_DEWEY_PULL.md` — how the pull is run.
5. `Code/GIS/dewey/dewey_pull_reduce.py` — the download+reduce script (stream a chunk → duckdb grid-filter to POIs near a UST facility → write small). `safegraph_places` registry entry is ready.
6. `Code/GIS/00_gis_config.R` — GIS config: CRS_ALBERS=EPSG:5070, STUDY_STATES, keys=(facility_id,state), helpers (load_master_coords, coords_to_sf, write_gis_lookup). Outputs → Data/Processed/GIS/.
7. `Code/GIS/01_SafeGraph_Crosswalk.R` — EXISTING facility→SafeGraph k-NN (FNN k=5) + Jaro-Winkler name matcher → ust_safegraph_xwalk.csv. **This is the anchor to reuse.** Has known bug F1 (hard-coded stale SG_PARQUET_DIR — must repoint to the reduced download dir).

## Current repo state (just synced)
- Local, GitHub `main`, and the server (ucbare2) are all at commit `7d33f20` — fully synced. All the GIS/Dewey tooling above is committed.
- Topology: code authored on LOCAL Windows clone (`C:\Users\kaleb\Documents\ust_ins_move_to_github`); the Dewey download + heavy parquet reduce RUN ON THE SERVER (`C:\Users\kalebkja\ust_ins_move_to_github`), which is where the data and DEWEY_API_KEY live. Both track origin/main.

## The workflow we're designing (and who does what)
- **STEP A — DOWNLOAD (researcher runs on the SERVER; I do NOT run it):** I set up the project/output folder and give the exact PowerShell. The user runs `Code\GIS\dewey\run_dewey_pull.ps1` (or the distilled command) to pull `safegraph_places`. It reduces to POIs near UST facilities and writes a small parquet to `DEWEY_Z_ROOT/_reduced_near_ust/safegraph_places_near_ust/`. Env on server: `DEWEY_Z_ROOT=C:\Users\kalebkja\dewey-downloads` (admin moved this to D: in 2026-06 but left a JUNCTION, so the C: path still works and now physically lands on D: — keep the C: path, don't hardcode a D: path), `UST_MASTER_CSV=...\Data\Processed\Master_Harmonized_UST_Tanks.csv`, `DEWEY_RUN=uvx`, `DEWEY_API_KEY` per-shell. Real pull = `uv run --with duckdb python Code\GIS\dewey\dewey_pull_reduce.py run safegraph_places`. (No-arg run = safe dry run, no download.)
- **STEP B — CROSSWALK (R):** repoint + run `01_SafeGraph_Crosswalk.R` against the reduced Places parquet → facility↔POI candidates, kept ALL candidates + is_best flag, scored by dist_m + name Jaro-Winkler. SafeGraph Global Places carries BRANDS, NAICS (2017 + 2022 vintages), TOP_CATEGORY/SUB_CATEGORY, lat/long, POLYGON_WKT.
- **STEP C — CLASSIFY (R, new module `05_operator_class.R`):** use matched POI BRAND/NAICS/category + facility_name + fuel flags to label each facility. Operator 4-bin waterfall (SCOPE §7.1): Government/other → Fleet/non-retail → Branded major → Independent retail. Output `gis_05_operator_class.csv`. Needs a hand-validation sample.

## Locked decisions (don't relitigate)
- Reduce filter = GEOGRAPHY (near-UST grid), NEVER NAICS (USTs include fleet/muni/farm sites).
- Crosswalk keeps all candidates + non-exclusive is_best; match = spatial k-NN + name JW (+ address where available).
- No CERS owner_type in the EPA panel → classification leans on SafeGraph BRAND + name heuristics + fuel flags + a researcher-reviewed brand dictionary (`Code/Helpers/brand_dictionary.R`, NEW).
- Retired code → Archive/, never delete.

## Open decisions to resolve early (SCOPE §9)
- Q1 (HARD PREREQ): per-state lat/long coverage in the Master file, especially TX (target state). Thin coords bias the spatial match. Audit coverage before trusting the crosswalk.
- Q4: approve the 4-bin operator waterfall + brand dictionary; how much hand-validation before it feeds the slide?
- Q5: download scope — confirm OK to stage SafeGraph Places (small, 72.1M national → tiny after near-UST reduce) onto the server's C: drive.

## Start by
1. Reading the files above and confirming you understand the download→crosswalk→classify chain.
2. Proposing the concrete folder setup + the exact PowerShell I should run on the server for STEP A (the SafeGraph Places pull), including a dry-run check first.
3. Flagging Q1 (coordinate coverage audit) as the gate before STEP B, and proposing how to run it.

Do NOT write/run estimation code or commit anything yet — plan and test the workflow first, then we cut tickets in spec_template.md format (number from 028 upward; check `.claude/TICKETS/` for the current max).
