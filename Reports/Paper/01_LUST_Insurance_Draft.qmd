  Public trust funds in thirty-eight U.S. states insure underground storage tank (UST) leaks at a uniform flat fee, even though leak risk varies widely with observable traits such as tank age and wall construction. This paper quantifies how replacing flat-fee pooling with actuarially priced coverage changes firm behavior and environmental outcomes. I exploit Texas’s 1999 closure of its trust fund, which forced all owners into a private market that sets premiums according to facility risk. A facility-year panel covering 1990–2021 links EPA inventories with administrative microdata for Texas and eighteen control states that retained public funds. Difference-in-differences and event-study estimates show that, among single-wall tanks installed before 1999, risk-rated premiums increased annual closure rates by two to three percentage points, shifted closures from market exit to on-site replacement with safer equipment, and reduced the probability of a reported leak by about one percentage point, nearly the entire pre-policy baseline for this high-risk group.  The findings provide the first causal micro-evidence that cost-based environmental liability insurance can internalize pollution risk more effectively than uniform public pooling, offering clear guidance for states that are reconsidering the structure of UST insurance programs.

# Introduction

Underground storage tanks holding motor fuels and other hazardous liquids sit beneath about half a million U.S. facilities, and leaks from these tanks are the leading documented source of groundwater contamination @epa_underground_2024. Cleanup is costly; median remediation expenses exceed $100 000 per site @marcus_going_2021, and the probability of a release rises sharply with observable characteristics such as tank age and whether the walls are single or double. Despite these predictable differences, thirty-eight states finance remediation through public trust funds that charge every facility the same premium, diluting incentives to invest in safer technology and crowding out private insurers @astswmo_archive.

Economic theory predicts that tying premiums to expected damages should induce firms to internalize environmental risk @shavell_liability_1984; @polinsky_strict_1980, yet empirical tests of this mechanism for USTs are scarce. Michigan’s mid-1990s shift toward private, risk-rated coverage suggested large gains but relied on aggregate counts that could not isolate facility-level responses @yin_can_2011; @yin_risk-based_2011. Whether actuarial pricing disciplines high-risk owners without simply driving them out of the market therefore remains unresolved.

Texas provides a clean natural experiment. In 1999 the state closed its public fund overnight and required all owners to purchase private coverage whose premiums vary with observable risk. I assemble a new facility-year panel covering 1990 to 2021 that links EPA inventories with administrative microdata from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and comparable data from eighteen control states that retained trust funds. A difference-in-differences design compares Texas with these fund states, and an event-study variant confirms parallel pre-trends.

Three main results emerge. First, among single-wall tanks installed before 1999, risk-based pricing raised annual closure probabilities by roughly two to three percentage points and shifted closures from outright exit to on-site replacement with safer equipment. Second, the probability of a reported leak fell by about one percentage point, nearly the entire pre-policy baseline for this high-risk group. Third, the effect on leak rates is concentrated among facilities that were already high-risk before the policy change, suggesting that cost-based pricing effectively targets riskier firms. By providing the first causal micro-evidence that actuarially priced environmental liability insurance changes firm behavior in hazardous industries, the paper speaks directly to current policy debates over the future of state UST funds.

**Related Literature**



A well-established body of theoretical work suggests that strict liability rules can be an effective policy instrument for environmental risks, particularly when paired with insurance contracts that align a firm's private incentives with social costs (@shavell_liability_1984, @shavell_model_1984, @shavell_liability_1982, @polinsky_strict_1980, @boyd_retroactive_1997, @shavell_chapter_2007). A crucial condition for this alignment is the insurer's ability to accurately price the risk of environmental harm. This paper provides the first empirical test of this principle in the context of environmental liability, offering causal estimates of how firms respond to a transition from flat-fee to more efficient, cost-based insurance contracts.

The challenge of pricing environmental risk connects this study to the broader economics literature on insurance and selection markets. Specifically, this paper builds on work examining the effects of cost-based pricing and contract design on market outcomes and participant behavior (@de_janvry_supply-_2010, @mcwilliams_new_2012, @einav_contract_2012, @einav_impact_2013, @brown_how_2014, @liberman_equilibrium_2018, @nelson_private_2025, @einav_io_2021). By studying the transition to risk-based premiums for environmental liability, this research contributes new evidence on how mispriced insurance can distort markets, particularly in hazardous industries where the social costs of pollution are significant.


This paper also contributes to the literature on U.S. UST policy. While much of the existing work focuses on estimating the marginal damages of pollution from leaks (@marcus_going_2021, @zabel_hedonic_2012, @guignet_sell_2014, @guignet_impacts_2018, @guignet_contamination_2018, @walsh_contaminated_2017, @guignet_what_2013), this study is complementary, examining the design of management policies intended to prevent those damages.

This research is most closely related to studies of a similar insurance market reform in Michigan by @yin_can_2011, @yin_risk-based_2011, and @yin_environmental_2007. That body of work finds that transitioning to risk-based insurance reduced the number of small firms and reported leaks. However, those analyses relied on aggregate or cross-sectional data, which cannot control for unobserved facility-level heterogeneity and may be susceptible to omitted variable bias.This research is most closely related to studies of a similar insurance market reform in Michigan by @yin_can_2011, @yin_risk-based_2011, and @yin_environmental_2007.

However, those analyses relied on aggregate or cross-sectional data, which cannot control for unobserved facility-level heterogeneity and may be susceptible to omitted variable bias. This paper advances on prior work by adopting an empirical strategy similar to other modern studies of environmental liability (@boomhower_drilling_2019). By using a rich, facility-level panel dataset, I can implement difference-in-differences models that control for unobserved facility characteristics and common time shocks, providing more credible causal estimates of how firms adjust their technology, replacement, and exit decisions in response to cost-based pricing.



# Institutional Background

## Underground Storage Tanks: Physical Characteristics and Environmental Risk

The construction technology of a UST system is the primary determinant of its environmental risk profile and the observable margin on which actuarial pricing differentiates. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines a UST system as any tank and connected underground piping with at least 10% of its volume below the surface [@epa_underground_2024]. The critical physical distinction within this capital stock is between single-walled systems, bare steel or fiberglass shells with no interstitial containment layer, and double-walled systems, which incorporate a secondary wall and continuous interstitial monitoring space. This construction choice is economically consequential at the point of installation and is effectively irreversible thereafter. In Texas, from 1998 to 2021, only 0.003% of active facilities ever retrofitted tank construction prior to terminal closure, confirming that investment decisions are concentrated at the extensive margins of initial installation and final exit. A facility's wall type is therefore a fixed, observable, and verifiable risk characteristic, precisely the conditions required for an actuarially feasible pricing margin.

Single-walled construction is cheaper to install but exhibits substantially higher failure rates than double-walled alternatives. Historical industry surveys document a persistent price differential: a 1987 GAO survey priced a standard 10,000-gallon single-walled unit at approximately \$23,000 versus \$39,000 for a comparable double-walled unit, a 67% premium that contemporaneous manufacturer filings confirm has persisted [@gao1987; @csi2021; @xerxes2018]. This cost-safety trade-off is borne out empirically in the cross-validation estimates reported in @fig-leak-risk: single-walled tanks exhibit a higher probability of a confirmed release than double-walled tanks at every age bracket, with the hazard gap widening after 15 years of operation. The existence of this predictable, observable, and quantifiable risk differential is what makes risk-based pricing both technically feasible for a private underwriter and potentially welfare-improving relative to a uniform-premium public fund.


## The Federal Regulatory Framework and the 1998 Upgrade Deadline

Federal regulation of USTs originates in the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which directed the EPA to establish comprehensive technical and financial standards for tank systems. The EPA finalized these technical standards in 40 CFR Part 280 in 1988, requiring all non-compliant tanks, those lacking corrosion protection, spill and overfill controls, and release detection, to be upgraded, replaced, or closed by a uniform federal compliance deadline of December 22, 1998 [@EPA2017USTCompendium; @us_epa_milestones_2021]. In the years immediately preceding this deadline, the average annual facility-level closure rate spiked as the industry retired the oldest and most non-compliant portion of the capital stock. Following the deadline, the closure rate fell, producing a persistently aging legacy fleet whose slow turnover is an institutional feature of the stock the empirical analysis examines. The December 22, 1998 federal mandate date is directly relevant to the identification strategy for reasons described in Section 2.4.



## Financial Responsibility and the State Trust Fund Regime

The 1988 Financial Responsibility Rule (40 CFR Part 280, Subpart H) mandates that every UST owner demonstrate the financial capacity to fund corrective action and satisfy third-party liability claims, with minimum required coverage of \$1 million per occurrence (40 CFR §280, Subpart H). In the late 1980s, the nascent private environmental insurance market was unable to supply this coverage at affordable cost to the population of small, single-site operators that constitute the majority of UST owners. To prevent widespread non-compliance, many states established public trust funds financed by annual tank registration fees or fuel tax revenues, functioning as a publicly administered insurer of last resort. A defining feature of these funds is their premium structure: annual fees are set on a uniform, per-tank basis, invariant to any observable facility risk characteristic such as wall type, tank age, or leak detection technology. States retaining public funds consistently report that these funds cover 90% to 100% of all active facilities, as documented by the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials [@astswmo_tank_surveys]. This near-complete market saturation is the predicted equilibrium outcome: because the subsidized uniform-premium contract is priced below any risk-differentiated private alternative for high-risk facilities, private insurers are structurally unable to compete for the portion of the market with above-average risk. The resulting uniform-premium pooling equilibrium is the institutional baseline against which Texas's transition is evaluated.


## Texas's Policy Transition: Treatment Exogeneity

Texas's departure from the public fund model constitutes a sharp, administratively determined policy discontinuity whose timing was driven by fiscal insolvency rather than any observable change in the statewide distribution of facility-level risk. Texas established the Petroleum Storage Tank Remediation Fund (PSTRF) in 1989 under the Texas Water Code. By 1995, actuarial assessments confirmed that the fund's liabilities, driven by the accumulating backlog of legacy remediation claims, were structurally unsustainable. In response, the 74th Texas Legislature enacted House Bill 2587, which mandated the sunset of the PSTRF [@HB2587_analysis_1995]. The legislature set the fund closure cutoff at December 22, 1998, the same calendar date as the federal EPA upgrade deadline codified in 40 CFR §280.21. The alignment of these two dates is not coincidental: the legislature explicitly selected the federal mandate date as the administrative anchor for the PSTRF cutoff, ensuring the fund would cease accepting new claims at precisely the moment when the largest cohort of non-compliant tanks was required to be addressed [@TexWaterCode_26_3512]. Effective December 22, 1998, all Texas UST owners were required to secure private insurance or qualify for self-insurance by demonstrating sufficient financial assets.



## The Texas Phased Mandate and the Mandate Confound

Texas's transition to private financial responsibility was preceded by a separate regulatory regime that is central to the identification strategy. Under 30 TAC Chapter 334, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission implemented a staggered upgrade schedule for pre-1988 underground storage tanks, assigning compliance deadlines by tank vintage cohort that ran from December 22, 1989 through December 22, 1993 (@tbl-mandate-schedule). Owners of the oldest tanks, those installed before 1965, faced a deadline nine years before the federal standard; owners of tanks installed between 1985 and 1988 faced a deadline five years before the federal standard. These mandates required cathodic protection installation, leak detection equipment, and site assessments, and carried enforcement authority including facility closure for noncompliance. No analogous staggered state mandate existed in any of the nineteen control states during this period; control state pre-1988 facilities faced only the uniform federal December 22, 1998 deadline.

The economic significance of this staggered schedule for identification is twofold. First, it created a mechanical wave of compliance-induced closures among Texas pre-1988 facilities between 1989 and 1993 with no counterpart among control state facilities during the same years. Facilities facing an imminent upgrade deadline confronted a discrete make-or-upgrade decision: invest in required cathodic protection and leak detection systems, or permanently close the tank. This decision is structurally identical to the closure margin targeted by the insurance reform and contaminates any pre-trend comparison that pools pre-1988 Texas and control facilities across the 1989--1998 window. A Wald test of joint pre-period coefficient nullity on the pooled sample confirms this contamination, rejecting parallel pre-trends at conventional significance levels (@tbl-pt-validation, Test 1). Second, the phased mandate fundamentally altered the composition of the surviving Texas pre-1988 tank stock by December 1998. The tanks still active as of the insurance reform cutoff represent the subset whose operators had already decided, when confronted with a compliance deadline between 1989 and 1993, to invest in upgrades rather than close. This survivor selection is documented in @tbl-mandate-exposure.

The primary identification sample is therefore restricted to facilities whose entire tank stock was installed after December 22, 1988, the post-1988 cohort, hereafter Spec A. Post-1988 tanks were subject to federal technical standards from installation and were never exposed to the Texas phased upgrade schedule. Their operators faced the insurance reform as a new and unanticipated financial liability shock, without any contemporaneous mandate-related make-or-upgrade decision. The parallel pre-trends test for the Spec A sample fails to reject the null of parallel pre-trends (@tbl-pt-validation, Test 2), supporting the identifying assumption for this subsample. This dual determination of the PSTRF cutoff date, coinciding with the federal mandate yet operating through a distinct fiscal insolvency channel, combined with the restriction to the mandate-free post-1988 cohort, provides the institutional foundation for the identifying assumption that the policy transition is orthogonal to facility-level pre-treatment trends.


## The Post-Transition Private Market in Texas

The private insurance market that absorbed the Texas UST population after December 1998 prices observable facility risk directly, generating the cross-sectional and intertemporal premium variation that identifies firm behavioral responses. From 2007 to 2021, the period for which granular financial responsibility administrative data are available from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), an average of 89.8% of active retail UST facilities in Texas satisfied their financial responsibility obligation through commercial private insurance. The remaining 10.2% relied on self-insurance mechanisms, available exclusively to large, financially capitalized owners who can satisfy stringent asset tests. The private market is dominated by a small number of specialist environmental insurers; Mid-Continent Casualty Company (NAIC 23418) operated as the primary underwriter for Texas UST risks throughout this period. Its actuarial rate filings, obtained from the System for Electronic Rates and Forms Filing (SERFF) for the periods 2006--2014, 2014--2019, 2019--2021, and 2021 onward, provide the rating algorithm underlying the premium reconstruction described in Section 3.6. A key structural feature confirmed in these rate filings is that premiums are a strictly increasing function of tank age and a strictly positive function of single-walled construction, while the per-tank rate is invariant to facility size. This pricing structure means that a Texas owner of an aging single-walled tank faces a marginal cost of continued operation that increases deterministically over time, the mechanism the dynamic model in Section 6 formalizes.


## Control Group Definition and Institutional Restrictions

The control group comprises nineteen states that retained public uniform-premium trust funds continuously throughout the study window of 1985 to 2020, subject to three institutional complications that require explicit treatment. First, New Jersey enacted a private insurance mandate effective May 19, 2003 (N.J.A.C. 7:14B-15.1), effectively becoming a treated unit after that date. I exclude New Jersey from the control group entirely, rather than restricting to pre-2003 observations, to avoid contaminating the control pool with a state undergoing a similar policy transition. Second, Tennessee did not establish an operational state trust fund until July 1, 2008 (Public Chapter 794). Prior to that date, Tennessee UST owners operated under a private insurance environment analogous to post-transition Texas. A diagnostic analysis of Tennessee's LUST reporting confirms zero confirmed leaks recorded in the administrative data across all years in the analysis window, consistent with an institutional artifact in which LUST reporting was administratively tied to fund participation. I exclude Tennessee from all leak-outcome specifications. Third, Maryland has never operated a state financial assurance fund [@astswmo_tank_surveys]. I retain Maryland in the analysis sample but flag it for robustness checks in which it is excluded; results are reported in Appendix B. With these three restrictions applied, nineteen states provide the valid uniform-premium counterfactual against which Texas's behavioral response is identified.




# Data

## Panel Architecture and Source Layers

The empirical analysis rests on a facility-year panel constructed by horizontally merging three distinct administrative data layers. The first layer is the behavioral backbone: a harmonized facility-year panel compiled from raw state-level UST administrative inventories and EPA summary files covering Texas and the nineteen control states from 1985 through 2020. This layer records, for each facility-year, the occurrence of tank closures, market exits, system retrofits, and confirmed leak incidents. The second layer is a tank-level physical inventory recording the installation date, closure date, wall construction type, capacity, fuel type, and current operational status for every individual tank associated with each facility. The third layer comprises financial data: private insurance premium estimates for Texas facilities, reconstructed from actuarial rate filings, and realized cleanup cost records for a subset of control states. The unit of observation throughout is the facility-year, and a unique panel identifier constructed from the state-standardized facility code and two-letter state abbreviation serves as the merge key across all three layers.


## Sample Construction and Attrition

I construct the estimation sample through four sequential filters, each motivated by a distinct identification requirement. @tbl-attrition reports the facility count and facility-year count remaining at each stage.

The first filter restricts the panel to the study window of 1985 through 2020, the interval over which administrative data coverage is sufficiently continuous across both the treated and control states to support pre-trend estimation and post-treatment tracking. The second filter restricts the sample to Texas and the nineteen control states defined in Section 2.6, having already excluded New Jersey as a treated unit and applied the Tennessee and Maryland institutional restrictions described there.

The third filter retains only incumbent facilities, defined as those first observed in the administrative records prior to the 1998 statutory treatment year. This restriction serves two purposes: it ensures that all facilities in the analysis sample faced the policy shock as an unanticipated constraint rather than an entry condition, and it eliminates any post-announcement compositional change in the market that would otherwise confound the treatment effect estimates.

The fourth filter excludes facilities for which critical tank-level date records are missing. A facility is excluded if any of its constituent tanks lacks an installation date, or if any tank recorded as closed lacks a closure date. This exclusion is applied at the facility level rather than the tank level because a missing date on a single tank would otherwise silently contaminate the closure timing and age-at-closure variables for the entire facility. The scale and distributional balance of this exclusion across the Texas and control groups are reported in @tbl-missing-balance. I estimate a logistic regression of the missing-date indicator on the Texas treatment indicator to test for differential attrition; the resulting balance test confirms that the probability of exclusion is orthogonal to the treatment assignment.

## Primary Outcome Variables

I construct three binary outcome variables at the facility-year level from the behavioral backbone. The primary outcome, $\text{Closure}_{it}$, equals one if facility $i$ recorded at least one tank closure event in calendar year $t$. Among facility-years in which $\text{Closure}_{it} = 1$, I construct two mutually exclusive conditional outcomes: $\text{Exit} \mid \text{Closure}_{it}$, equal to one if the facility permanently exited the market in year $t$, and $\text{Replace} \mid \text{Closure}_{it}$, equal to one if the facility closed a tank but remained operational, implying on-site replacement. The environmental outcome, $\text{Leak}_{it}$, equals one if facility $i$ reported a confirmed release to state regulators in year $t$, drawn from the harmonized Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) incident records. All outcome variables are defined at the facility-year level by aggregating the underlying monthly records to an annual frequency.

For the event study specifications, I define relative event time as $k = \text{year} - 1999$, indexed to the first full post-treatment calendar year such that $k = -1$ corresponds to calendar year 1998 (the omitted baseline category) and post-treatment effects are identified for $k \geq 0$. The event study window spans 1985 to 2018.


## The 1998 Cross-Section and Tank-Level Stock Variables

I construct a cross-sectional snapshot of the active tank stock as of December 22, 1998 by retaining all tanks that satisfy two conditions: an installation date on or before December 22, 1998, and a closure date either missing or strictly after December 22, 1998. This cross-section records the physical characteristics of the capital stock at the moment of the policy shock and serves two functions. First, it supplies the stock-level covariates, including tank age as of the treatment date and wall construction type, that enter the regression specifications as controls and define the main analysis subsamples. Tank age as of the treatment date is computed as the elapsed time between installation date and December 22, 1998, expressed in years. Second, it provides the basis for the 1998 summary statistics reported in Panel A of @tbl-descriptive.

The pre-1988 vintage indicator equals one for tanks installed on or before December 22, 1988, the federal mandate cutoff codified in 40 CFR §280.21. This cutoff defines the Spec B subsample used in supplementary estimates: the pre-1988 cohort that is exposed to the Texas phased mandate. The primary estimation sample (Spec A) is restricted to facilities whose entire tank stock was installed after December 22, 1988. The Texas phased mandate schedule, which imposed earlier compliance deadlines on pre-1988 tanks according to their installation vintage under 30 TAC Chapter 334, is documented in @tbl-mandate-schedule. I assign each pre-1988 Texas tank its cohort-specific mandate deadline and compute years past the applicable deadline as of December 22, 1998, the mandate exposure variable reported in @tbl-mandate-exposure.

## Private Insurance Premium Reconstruction

Private insurers do not publicly disclose individual policy premiums. I reconstruct the premium schedule that Texas facilities faced in the post-transition period by building a bottom-up actuarial rating engine from the rate filings of Mid-Continent Casualty Company (NAIC 23418). I obtain rate manuals filed with the System for Electronic Rates and Forms Filing (SERFF) covering four regulatory periods: 2006--2014, 2014--2019, 2019--2021, and 2021 onward. These filings provide the complete pricing algorithm, including base rates, Increased Limit Factors (ILF), and all secondary risk loads applied to observable facility characteristics.

I estimate the monthly premium $P_{ijt}$ for tank $j$ at facility $i$ in month $t$ as:

$$
P_{ijt} = \text{Base}_{t} \times \text{ILF}_{it} \times \left(1 + \sum_{k} \lambda_{k,t} \mathbf{X}_{ijt}\right)
$$

where $\text{Base}_{t}$ is the per-tank base rate active in filing period $t$, $\text{ILF}_{it}$ is the Increased Limit Factor adjusting for the elected coverage limit (defaulting to the statutory \$1 million per occurrence minimum where unspecified), and $\mathbf{X}_{ijt}$ is a vector of observable risk characteristics including tank age bin, wall construction type, piping type, and installed leak detection technology. The parameters $\lambda_{k,t}$ are the secondary risk loads, additive percentage credits or debits, assigned to each characteristic in filing period $t$.

Three implementation assumptions are required. First, I hold the base rate constant within each filing period at its filed value, consistent with the filing terms. Second, for risk characteristics unobserved in the administrative records (including aquifer proximity and flood zone classification), I set the corresponding risk load to zero, yielding a conservative estimate of the true premium. Third, the rate filings permit underwriters to apply schedule rating adjustments of $\pm$40% at their discretion; I use the base manual premium as the price signal and treat discretionary adjustments as mean-zero errors across the population, an assumption evaluated against the distribution of observed financial responsibility filings in the TCEQ records.

Granular premium microdata are available beginning in 2006. The period from January 1999 through December 2005 represents a transition window in which the private market was operational but individual premium records are not observed. For this window, I assume stationarity of the conditional premium distribution relative to the 2006 filing period and apply an aggregate inflation deflator to recover real premium levels. This imputation implies that the structural estimates of price sensitivity $\gamma_{\text{price}}$ are identified primarily from post-2006 variation.



## Cleanup Cost Distribution

To calibrate the damage function $L(x_t)$ in the structural model of Section 6, I link administrative facility identifiers to payment ledgers of state underground storage tank trust funds in Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Utah. This six-state sample spans the full set of control-group states for which verified per-incident cleanup cost records could be obtained from public administrative data. All cost figures are deflated to 2023 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).

The pooled distribution of realized cleanup costs conditional on a confirmed release is characterized by extreme positive skewness and rejects normality in favor of a heavy-tailed log-normal structure. The right tail is a structural feature of UST environmental liability rather than an artifact of particular state administrative procedures: as @fig-cost-distribution-states demonstrates, the heavy upper tail is consistent across all six sampled fund states, despite variation in program design, geography, and claim volumes. @fig-cost-distribution presents the pooled log-scale density, with vertical lines marking the median and mean, illustrating the two-plus-order-of-magnitude gap between typical and catastrophic remediation events.

To examine what observable facility characteristics correlate with remediation severity, @tbl-claims-regression reports OLS estimates of log cleanup cost on facility-level covariates measured in the year of the confirmed release. Column (1) includes state fixed effects and documents a positive age gradient: older tank installations are associated with larger cleanup costs, consistent with cumulative corrosion and degraded containment. Column (2) adds year fixed effects. Facilities operating single-walled tanks face higher remediation costs, while double-walled containment is associated with smaller claims. The age gradient and wall-type penalty survive the inclusion of both state and year fixed effects, suggesting the correlations reflect physical deterioration mechanisms rather than state-specific administrative practices or secular trends in remediation technology. Column (3) interacts containment type with tank age bins, revealing that the single-walled cost penalty widens monotonically with age.

These descriptive relationships do not identify causal effects of tank characteristics on cleanup costs; they serve to validate the structural model's assumption that the damage function $L(x_t)$ depends on the physical state vector and to inform the machine-learning prediction stage in which Random Survival Forests generate facility-specific expected cost inputs for the dynamic discrete choice model.

## Descriptive Statistics

@tbl-descriptive reports summary statistics in two panels. Panel A characterizes the 1998 cross-section of active tanks as of the treatment date, separately for Texas and the control group. Panel B reports pre-period flow averages over 1989 to 1997, stratified by installation cohort to document the distinct pre-period dynamics of the Spec A (post-1988) and Spec B (pre-1988) subsamples. Calendar year 1998 is excluded from the Panel B calculations to avoid contamination from anticipatory behavior in the final pre-treatment year.

Panel A documents the comparability of the capital stock on the treatment date. The contrast between the Texas and control groups on the pre-1988 share reflects survivor selection from the phased mandate: Texas pre-1988 tanks active at December 22, 1998 had already cleared a cohort-specific compliance hurdle between 1989 and 1993, whereas control state pre-1988 tanks were encountering their first compliance deadline simultaneously with the insurance reform.

Panel B documents pre-period behavioral patterns separately for the Spec A (post-1988 only), Spec B (pre-1988 only), and mixed cohort subsamples. The contrast between the Spec A and Spec B rows is direct evidence of the mandate confound. Among Spec A facilities, pre-period closure rates are nearly identical across Texas and the control group, consistent with the parallel trends established in @fig-pretrend-closure. Among Spec B facilities, the control group exhibits a higher pre-period closure rate than Texas, reflecting the Texas phased mandate's prior exhaustion of the highest-risk and most closure-prone pre-1988 tanks. This survivor-selection gap is the mechanical pre-trend violation documented formally in @tbl-pt-validation and confirms that valid identification requires either restricting to the Spec A sample or controlling for cohort-specific mandate dynamics in Spec B specifications.

## Parallel Trends Validation

@tbl-pt-validation reports the four-test parallel trends validation battery. Test 1 (pooled, no controls) rejects the null of parallel pre-trends, confirming the mandate contamination predicted by the institutional analysis in Section 2.5. Test 2 (Spec A, no controls) fails to reject the null, supporting the primary identification assumption. Test 3 (Spec B, no controls) rejects without mandate controls. Test 4 (Spec B with `mandate_active` indicator) substantially attenuates the rejection, confirming that the phased mandate schedule accounts for most of the pre-period divergence in the Spec B sample. The Spec B controlled specification is used in the supplementary robustness results; the primary causal estimates rely exclusively on the Spec A sample.

## Financial Responsibility and the Insurance Regime

To mitigate the liability associated with these environmental risks, the EPA's 1988 Financial Responsibility Rule (40 CFR Part 280, Subpart H) mandates that owners secure coverage for corrective action and third-party liability, typically $1 million per occurrence. In the late 1980s, the immaturity of the private environmental insurance market led many states to establish public trust funds. These funds typically operate on a flat-fee basis, charging uniform premiums regardless of facility-specific risk. While effective at ensuring solvency, this pooling mechanism creates a price externality that distorts incentives for risk mitigation. In states retaining such funds, they consistently cover 90% to 100% of facilities.

Texas initially utilized a public fund model but diverged in 1998 following the passage of House Bill 2587. Facing actuarial insolvency, the legislature sunset the Texas Petroleum Storage Tank Remediation Fund, forcing the entire facility population to migrate to the private market or self-insure by 1999. This sharp policy discontinuity serves as the central identification strategy. In the post-transition period (2007–2021), 89.8% of Texas retail facilities met their obligations through private insurance, with the remainder relying on self-insurance mechanisms available only to highly capitalized firms.

# Conceptual Framework: Insurance Design and Optimal Stopping

The facility owner's decision is modeled as a single-agent dynamic discrete choice problem following the optimal stopping literature (Rust, 1987). In an infinite horizon setting with time indexed by $t$, the agent operates a single underground storage tank (UST) and observes the state variable $a_t$, representing the tank's age. At the beginning of each period, the agent chooses a binary action $d_t \in \{ \text{Maintain}, \text{Close} \}$ to maximize the expected present discounted value of future payoffs. If the agent chooses to close ($d_t = \text{Close}$), the facility exits the market permanently, receiving a terminal scrap value $\kappa$ representing the liquidity of the land net of decommissioning costs. Conditional on maintenance ($d_t = \text{Maintain}$), the flow utility is specified as $u(a_t) = R - P_j(a_t)$, where $R$ denotes the annual net revenue from operations less all non-insurance costs, and $P_j(a_t)$ is the insurance premium under regime $j$. While the structural estimation in Section 5 relaxes this assumption to incorporate deductibles and partial risk internalization, this simplified framework assumes full insurance coverage for tractability, treating environmental risk solely as an ex-ante premium cost rather than an ex-post liability shock. The agent’s value function $V(a)$ satisfies the Bellman equation:

$$
V(a) = \max \left\{ R - P_j(a) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(a') \mid a], \kappa \right\}
$$

where $\beta \in (0, 1)$ is the discount factor and the expectation is taken over the stochastic evolution of tank age. The optimal stopping rule dictates that the firm closes the tank when the continuation value of operation falls below the scrap value $\kappa$.

The divergence in firm behavior across states is driven by the elasticity of the premium function $P_j(a)$ with respect to capital depreciation. Under the **Uniform Premium (Public Fund)** regime, the price is invariant to risk, such that $P(a) = \bar{P}$ and the marginal cost of aging is zero ($\frac{\partial P}{\partial a} = 0$). This flat pricing structure eliminates the financial incentive to retire aging capital, pivoting the continuation value curve upward and causing the firm to retain the asset until it is physically obsolete, defined as age $a^*_{UP}$. Conversely, under the **Risk-Based (Private Market)** regime, premiums are strictly increasing in the leak hazard rate $h(a)$, such that $\frac{\partial P}{\partial a} > 0$. This introduces a positive marginal cost of aging, pivoting the value function downward for older tanks and accelerating the optimal exit age to $a^*_{RB}$. Figure 1 illustrates this mechanism, demonstrating that the introduction of risk-based pricing strictly reduces the optimal tank lifespan relative to the uniform pricing baseline ($a^*_{RB} < a^*_{UP}$).

![The Mechanism: Optimal Stopping under Alternative Insurance Regimes](Output/Figures/Paper/Fig_1_Mechanism.pdf){#fig-mechanism width=90%}

While risk-based pricing improves allocative efficiency by penalizing higher failure rates, it does not achieve the first-best social optimum due to unpriced health externalities. The social planner’s objective function includes both the remediation costs ($L$) covered by insurers and the health damages ($E$) from groundwater contamination, which are typically unobservable and generate no third-party claims (Marcus, 2021). Consequently, the private actuarial premium $P_{RB} \propto h(a)L$ is strictly less than the social marginal cost $h(a)(L+E)$. This wedge implies that while the private market induces earlier exit than the public fund, the equilibrium exit age $a^*_{RB}$ remains higher than the socially optimal age $a^*_{SOC}$. Figure 2 visualizes this welfare loss, identifying the shaded region between $a^*_{SOC}$ and $a^*_{RB}$ as the uninternalized externality. The theoretical prediction for the empirical analysis is therefore a monotonic ordering of tank lifespans where $a^*_{SOC} < a^*_{RB} < a^*_{UP}$.

![Welfare Analysis: The Externality Wedge and Partial Correction](Output/Figures/Paper/Fig_2_Welfare.pdf){#fig-welfare width=90%}




# Empirical Framework

## Estimation Strategy

The primary estimating equation is:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \beta \cdot (\text{Texas}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \epsilon_{it}
$${#eq-did-primary}

where $Y_{it}$ denotes the outcome of interest for facility $i$ in year $t$, $\alpha_i$ and $\lambda_t$ represent facility and year fixed effects respectively, $\text{Texas}_i$ is an indicator equal to one if facility $i$ is located in Texas, $\text{Post}_t$ is an indicator equal to one for calendar years $t \geq 1999$ (the first full post-treatment year following the December 22, 1998 PSTRF cutoff), and $\epsilon_{it}$ is an idiosyncratic error term. The coefficient of interest is $\beta$, which captures the average treatment effect of the transition to private risk-based insurance under the assumption of parallel counterfactual trends. I cluster standard errors at the state level to account for within-state serial correlation across facility-year observations (20 clusters: Texas plus the nineteen control states). Given the small number of clusters, I supplement conventional cluster-robust inference with wild cluster bootstrap $p$-values using the Webb six-point distribution, which provides reliable finite-sample inference with a small number of clusters [@cameron_gelbach_miller_2008; @mackinnon_nielsen_webb_2023].

A controlled specification augments @eq-did-primary with the facility's mean tank age as of 1998 to absorb residual cross-sectional heterogeneity in capital vintage. This specification is not the baseline because mean age is a predetermined covariate that should not affect the treatment coefficient under parallel trends; I report it to demonstrate robustness.

The corresponding event-study specification is:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{\substack{k = k_{\min} \\ k \neq -1}}^{k_{\max}} \beta_k \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{rel\_year}_{it} = k] \cdot \text{Texas}_i + \epsilon_{it}
$${#eq-event-study}

where $\text{rel\_year}_{it} = t - 1999$ indexes event time, $k = -1$ is the omitted reference period, and the coefficients $\{\beta_k\}_{k < -1}$ serve as a direct test of the parallel trends assumption. The event study window spans 1985 to 2018. Endpoints are binned to absorb composition effects from late entrants and early exits.


## The Three-Specification Mandate Confound Architecture

The institutional analysis in Section 2.5 establishes that the Texas phased upgrade mandate (30 TAC Chapter 334, 1989--1993) creates a pre-treatment confound for facilities holding pre-1988 tanks. I address this confound through a three-specification architecture that varies the sample restriction and control set to isolate the insurance reform effect from the mandate artifact.

**Specification A (Headline).** The estimation sample is restricted to facilities whose entire active tank stock as of December 22, 1998 was installed after December 22, 1988. These post-1988 facilities were never subject to the Texas phased mandate and faced the insurance reform as a new, unanticipated financial liability shock. Spec A is the primary identification sample, and its results constitute the headline causal estimates. The parallel pre-trends test for Spec A fails to reject the null (@tbl-pt-validation, Test 2).

**Specification B (Robustness).** The estimation sample is restricted to facilities whose entire active tank stock was installed on or before December 22, 1988. These pre-1988 facilities were directly exposed to the Texas phased mandate. I augment @eq-did-primary with two controls: (i) a binary indicator $\text{mandate\_active}_{it}$, equal to one for Texas Spec B facility-years falling within the facility's cohort-specific mandate compliance window, and (ii) mandate cohort-by-year fixed effects ($\text{mandate\_cohort}_i \times \lambda_t$) to absorb differential time paths across the five vintage cohorts defined in @tbl-mandate-schedule. The mandate controls attenuate the pre-trend rejection substantially (@tbl-pt-validation, Test 4), though interpretation of the residual Spec B estimates requires caution because the surviving pre-1988 Texas stock is selected on prior compliance decisions.

**Pooled Specification (Diagnostic).** The full estimation sample with mandate controls included. I report this specification solely as a diagnostic comparison; the pooled estimate is interpreted cautiously due to residual mandate contamination that mandate controls only partially absorb.


## Identification Strategy

The ideal experiment would randomly assign some state UST populations to a risk-based private insurance regime while holding others at the flat-fee public fund, with random assignment ensuring that treated and control populations are identical in expectation on all dimensions other than insurance pricing. The Texas PSTRF closure approximates this experiment by generating a sharp, administratively determined treatment assignment driven by fiscal insolvency rather than any facility-level behavioral margin.

The identifying assumption is that, in the absence of the PSTRF closure, Texas Spec A facilities would have followed the same closure, replacement, and leak trajectories as control state facilities with similar observable characteristics. I evaluate this assumption against three specific threats.

*Unobserved heterogeneity.* Facility fixed effects absorb all time-invariant differences between Texas and control facilities, including geographic sorting, local market conditions, and operator type. Year fixed effects absorb common macroeconomic shocks, fuel price movements, and federal regulatory changes affecting all states simultaneously. The residual identifying variation is within-facility, over-time deviation from both the facility's own mean and the common time path.

*Reverse causality.* The direction of causality cannot plausibly run from facility-level closure or leak behavior to the state-level legislative decision to sunset the PSTRF. The fund closure was driven by an aggregate fiscal shortfall accumulated over the prior decade, not by contemporaneous facility-level behavioral changes. The statutory treatment date was codified in 1995 [@HB2587_analysis_1995] and anchored to the pre-existing federal mandate date, further insulating it from endogenous facility responses.

*Measurement error.* The primary outcome variables, closure, exit, and replacement, are constructed from administrative records of tank installation and closure dates filed with state regulators. These dates are legal compliance events rather than survey responses, limiting classical measurement error. The leak outcome is measured from LUST reports, which may undercount releases that go undetected. If private insurance increases monitoring intensity, the measured leak effect combines a true risk reduction with a detection channel; I discuss this distinction in the results interpretation.

*Stable Unit Treatment Value.* The treatment applied to Texas facilities does not plausibly contaminate outcomes in control states. UST insurance markets are state-regulated, and there is no institutional mechanism by which Texas's policy change would alter premium structures or regulatory behavior in control state trust funds. Cross-state facility migration is negligible because UST installations are fixed capital tied to real estate.





# Results

## Primary Causal Estimates: Closure, Exit, and Replacement

The transition to risk-based insurance increased annual closure probabilities among Spec A facilities. @tbl-reg-closure reports the headline difference-in-differences estimates. The estimated coefficient on the $\text{Texas} \times \text{Post}$ interaction for the closure outcome is positive and statistically significant, identified through within-facility variation over time net of facility and year fixed effects. The baseline specification and the controlled specification (augmented with mean tank age as of 1998) yield estimates of similar magnitude, confirming that the result is not driven by differential capital vintage across the treatment and control groups.

Among facility-years in which a closure occurred, I decompose the closure event into two mutually exclusive margins. The coefficient on the exit margin is negative: Texas facilities that closed tanks after the reform were less likely to exit the market entirely relative to control-state counterparts. The coefficient on the replacement margin is positive: conditional on closure, Texas facilities were more likely to replace the closed tank with new equipment while continuing operations. The point estimates on these conditional margins imply that risk-based pricing shifted the composition of closure events from market exit toward on-site technology upgrading.

## Visual Evidence: Event Studies

@fig-es-closure-specA presents the event study for Spec A closure probability. The pre-treatment coefficients ($k \leq -2$) are uniformly indistinguishable from zero, providing visual confirmation of the parallel trends assumption for the mandate-free sample. The joint Wald test of pre-period coefficients fails to reject the null. Beginning at $k = 0$, the treatment effect is positive and increases in magnitude over the post-reform period, consistent with a persistent and growing behavioral response to the new insurance pricing regime. The expanding post-treatment coefficients are consistent with a compounding mechanism: as tanks age under risk-based pricing, the marginal cost of continued operation rises deterministically via the premium schedule documented in Section 3.6, producing an accelerating incentive to close.

The estimated coefficient on the $\text{Texas} \times \text{Post}$ interaction for Spec A is negative and statistically significant at the 1% level. The addition of mean tank age as a control does not materially alter the estimate. The Spec B estimate (with mandate controls) and the pooled estimate (with mandate controls) are also negative, though the Spec B and pooled coefficients are interpreted cautiously given residual mandate contamination.

The measured leak reduction operates through two non-exclusive channels. The replacement effect: by accelerating the retirement of leak-prone tanks and their replacement with newer technology, the policy mechanically reduces the stock of high-risk capital. The exit effect: the departure of the highest-risk facilities from the market further lowers the aggregate leak rate. The data cannot separately identify a third potential channel, improved maintenance by continuing operators, from these compositional effects, because maintenance investments are unobserved.

## Robustness

I evaluate the sensitivity of the headline Spec A estimates through five complementary checks. First, the Spec B estimates with escalating mandate controls (@tbl-specb-robustness) demonstrate that the treatment effect survives the inclusion of the `mandate_active` indicator, mandate cohort-by-year fixed effects, and cohort-specific linear trends.

  cat(readLines(table_path), sep = "\n")
} else {
  cat("\\textit{Table 4 not found. Run 02\\_DiD\\_Results\\_Mandate\\_update.R.}")
}
```

The Spec B point estimates on closure are positive and of comparable magnitude to the Spec A headline, though estimated less precisely due to the smaller effective sample and residual selection from the mandate. Second, I exclude Maryland, the sole control state without a state fund, and re-estimate the Spec A specifications; the results are stable. Third, I implement the @roth_2022 pre-test power diagnostic to assess whether the Spec A pre-trend test has sufficient statistical power to detect a linear violation of parallel trends large enough to explain the headline estimate. Fourth, I conduct the @rambachan_roth_2023 sensitivity analysis, computing robust confidence sets under progressively relaxed assumptions about the magnitude and smoothness of potential post-treatment trend violations. Fifth, I implement a @goodman_bacon_2021 decomposition of the pooled TWFE estimate to verify that the Spec A design, which features a clean two-group, single-treatment-date structure, does not suffer from the heterogeneous treatment effect contamination that afflicts staggered designs.


## Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: Wall Type

The theoretical mechanism predicts that the closure response should be concentrated among facilities with a higher fraction of single-walled tanks, because the private insurance pricing schedule loads most heavily on single-walled construction. I test this prediction by interacting the treatment indicator with the facility-level share of single-walled tanks. The interaction coefficient is positive and statistically significant for Spec A, confirming that facilities with greater single-walled exposure exhibited a larger closure response to the insurance reform. This heterogeneity is consistent with the pricing mechanism: the marginal cost of continued operation under risk-based insurance increases most sharply for precisely those facilities whose tank stock the private market penalizes most heavily.





# Discussion

The reduced-form results establish three core findings. First, the transition from flat-fee public insurance to actuarially priced private coverage increased annual closure probabilities among incumbent facilities that were never exposed to the confounding Texas phased mandate. Second, this closure response was compositionally skewed toward on-site replacement rather than market exit: facilities subject to risk-based pricing retired their existing capital but continued operations with safer technology. Third, the reform reduced reported leak incidence, indicating that the behavioral response translated into measurable environmental improvement.

The economic interpretation of these findings centers on the pricing mechanism embedded in the private insurance market. Under the flat-fee public fund, the marginal cost of retaining an aging tank is zero with respect to observable risk: premiums do not increase as tanks age or deteriorate. Under the private market, the Mid-Continent rate schedule documented in Section 3.6 imposes discrete premium step-ups at actuarial age thresholds, generating a time-varying cost of continued operation that is increasing in precisely the risk characteristics that predict leaks. The Spec A estimates capture the behavioral response to this newly introduced price signal among facilities for which the insurance reform was the sole contemporaneous policy shock.

The concentration of the closure response among high-single-walled-share facilities strengthens the pricing interpretation. If the treatment effect were driven by a general economic shock coincident with the fund closure, for example, a Texas-specific recession or regulatory enforcement campaign, the response would not exhibit systematic heterogeneity along the pricing margin that distinguishes single-walled from double-walled tanks. The observed heterogeneity is consistent with a price-elastic response to the specific cost differentials embedded in the actuarial rating algorithm.

The shift from exit to replacement conditional on closure has direct welfare implications. A policy that merely accelerates the shutdown of high-risk facilities achieves environmental gains at the cost of reduced economic activity and employment in the affected communities. The replacement margin documented here suggests that risk-based insurance achieves environmental improvement through capital upgrading rather than capacity destruction, a more efficient outcome that preserves the service flow (fuel distribution) while reducing the associated externality. The welfare analysis in Section 6 formalizes this distinction by estimating the consumer surplus retained under replacement versus the deadweight loss from exit.

Two important caveats qualify the external validity of these estimates. First, the Spec A sample comprises post-1988 facilities that were subject to federal technical standards from installation. These facilities are, on average, younger and better-equipped than the pre-1988 stock. The treatment effect for the pre-1988 cohort, which carries higher baseline risk and faces steeper premium gradients, may differ in magnitude; the Spec B robustness estimates provide suggestive evidence on this margin but cannot be causally interpreted with the same confidence. Second, the Texas policy transition was a complete, overnight regime shift from public to private insurance. States considering incremental reforms, such as risk-adjusted surcharges within an existing fund structure, face a different policy environment in which the behavioral response may be attenuated by partial premium adjustments or regulatory uncertainty.

Thirty-eight states currently operate flat-fee UST trust funds. The Texas evidence shows that observable facility characteristics, principally tank age and wall construction, generate predictable variation in environmental risk that private insurers can price. The behavioral response to this pricing is consistent with the theoretical prediction that tying premiums to expected damages induces firms to internalize pollution risk [@Shavell1984; @polinsky_strict_1980]. The mechanism of environmental improvement operates through capital turnover incentives rather than punitive exit: risk-based pricing accelerates the replacement of hazardous infrastructure without destroying the economic capacity it supports.




#  Dynamic Discrete Choice Model

In this section, I develop a dynamic structural model of the facility owner's decision problem. The framework follows the optimal stopping literature where agents weigh the immediate returns of operation against the liability risks of aging capital @rust_optimal_1987.

## 3.1 The Agent's Problem

I model the behavior of a risk-neutral facility owner operating a single underground storage tank in an infinite horizon setting. Time is discrete and indexed by $t=1, 2, \dots, \infty$. In each period, the agent observes the state of the facility, $x_t$, and a vector of idiosyncratic payoff shocks, $\varepsilon_t$. Conditional on these states, the agent chooses a binary action $d_t \in \{Maintain, Close\}$ to maximize the expected present discounted value of future payoffs. The discount factor is denoted by $\beta \in (0, 1)$.

## State Space and Transitions

The observable state vector $x_t = (A_t, w_t, \rho_t)$ characterizes the facility's physical and regulatory environment. The variable $A_t \in \{1, \dots, 9\}$ represents the age of the tank, discretized into five-year bins, where $A=9$ is an absorbing state for tanks older than 40 years. The variable $w_t \in \{Single, Double\}$ denotes the tank's wall type, which is fixed over time. Finally, $\rho_t \in \{FF, RB\}$ indicates the insurance regime, where $FF$ represents the flat-fee public fund and $RB$ represents the risk-based private market.

The state transition process is governed by the facility's choice. If the agent chooses to close the facility ($d_t = Close$), the process terminates. If the agent chooses to maintain the facility ($d_t = Maintain$), the tank ages stochastically. I define the transition probability $F(x_{t+1} | x_t, d_t)$ such that wall type and regime are persistent, while age follows a stochastic process:

$$
A_{t+1} = \begin{cases} 
A_t + 1 & \text{with probability } \pi_{up}(A_t) \\
A_t & \text{with probability } 1 - \pi_{up}(A_t)
\end{cases}
$$

This stochastic aging process captures the uncertainty in asset depreciation and allows the model to match the empirical duration of tank active life.

## Flow Payoffs

The period payoff depends on the chosen action and the structural parameters governing revenue, costs, and risk preferences. Payoffs are normalized such that the net revenue from operation is the numeraire.

If the agent chooses to **Maintain**, the flow utility is specified as:

$$
u(x_t, Maintain) = 1 + \gamma_{price} \cdot P(x_t) - \gamma_{risk} \cdot h(x_t) \cdot L(x_t)
$$

The first term, $1$, represents the normalized annual net revenue. The second term captures the disutility of insurance premiums, where $P(x_t)$ is the observed premium and $\gamma_{price}$ is the price sensitivity parameter. The third term represents the internalized cost of environmental risk, where $h(x_t)$ is the engineering hazard rate of a leak, $L(x_t)$ is the expected remediation cost, and $\gamma_{risk}$ is a scaling parameter. A value of $\gamma_{risk} < 1$ would imply moral hazard, where firms undervalue the true expected liability.

If the agent chooses to **Close**, the facility exits the market and the agent receives a terminal scrap value:

$$
u(x_t, Close) = \kappa
$$

The parameter $\kappa$ captures the liquidation value of the land and equipment, net of any decommissioning costs. This value is assumed to be constant across states.

## The Value Function

The agent's optimization problem can be represented by the Bellman equation. Assuming the idiosyncratic shocks $\varepsilon_t$ follow a Type I Extreme Value distribution with scale parameter $\sigma$, the ex-ante value function $V(x_t)$ is given by:

$$
V(x_t) = \int \max_{d \in \{M, C\}} \left\{ v(x_t, d) + \varepsilon_t(d) \right\} dG(\varepsilon)
$$

where $v(x_t, d)$ represents the conditional choice-specific value function:

$$
v(x_t, d) = u(x_t, d) + \beta \sum_{x_{t+1}} V(x_{t+1}) F(x_{t+1} | x_t, d)
$$

This structure allows for the estimation of the structural parameters $\theta = (\kappa, \gamma_{price}, \gamma_{risk})$ using a Nested Pseudo-Likelihood (NPL) estimator (Aguirregabiria & Mira, 2007).

## Identification

The identification of the structural parameters $\theta = (\kappa, \gamma_{price}, \gamma_{risk})$ relies on mapping distinct sources of data variation to specific model primitives. While the parameters are estimated jointly via the Nested Pseudo-Likelihood algorithm, we can heuristically characterize the variation that identifies each term.

The scrap value, $\kappa$, is identified by the unconditional probability of facility exit. In the optimal stopping framework, $\kappa$ acts as the reservation value; therefore, a higher average exit rate across all states implies a higher relative scrap value, holding flow profits constant. Identification requires that the baseline exit rate is not driven solely by unobserved heterogeneity, which we address through the inclusion of facility-level fixed effects in the reduced-form steps.

The price sensitivity parameter, $\gamma_{price}$, is identified by the response of exit rates to cross-sectional variation in insurance premiums. The transition from the flat-fee Public Fund (FF) to the risk-based private market (RB) generates exogenous variation in $P(x_t)$ that is independent of the facility's engineering risk. Specifically, under the FF regime, premiums are constant ($\frac{\partial P}{\partial A} = 0$), whereas under the RB regime, premiums rise with age ($\frac{\partial P}{\partial A} > 0$). The covariance between these policy-induced price shocks and subsequent closure decisions isolates the agent's marginal disutility of payment.

The risk internalization parameter, $\gamma_{risk}$, is identified by the gradient of exit rates with respect to the leak hazard $h(x_t)$, distinct from the premium channel. While premiums in the private market are correlated with risk, the correlation is not perfect due to deductible structures and coverage limits. If firms face liability costs beyond the premium (e.g., deductibles or reputational harm), they will exit high-risk states at a rate faster than predicted by premium costs alone. This residual sensitivity of the exit rule to the engineering hazard rate $h(A_t)$ identifies $\gamma_{risk}$.


# Discussion

The empirical results present a clear and compelling narrative about the power of market-based environmental policy. The transition to risk-adjusted insurance premiums in Texas prompted a significant and rational response from the owners of the highest-risk USTs. Faced with insurance costs that reflected the true environmental hazard of their aging, single-walled tanks, owners accelerated their closure. Critically, this did not lead to a mass exodus from the market. Instead, the policy spurred investment in safer technology, as facilities were more likely to replace their risky tanks rather than shut down entirely. This finding directly addresses a common concern that stringent environmental pricing will simply drive firms out of business, demonstrating instead that it can be a powerful catalyst for technology adoption.

This behavioral shift from retaining old, risky assets to investing in new, safer ones translated directly into improved environmental outcomes. The nearly one-percentage-point reduction in the annual leak rate for this high-risk cohort is not only statistically significant but also economically meaningful, representing a near-elimination of the pre-policy baseline risk. This provides strong causal evidence that aligning private insurance costs with public environmental risk can effectively internalize externalities. The success of the Texas model offers a clear lesson for the many states still relying on flat-fee public funds, which mute price signals and subsidize the continued operation of the riskiest facilities.

The findings underscore that when risk is observable and can be priced, insurance markets can function as a powerful regulatory tool. The stark difference in leak probabilities between single- and double-walled tanks, which grows with age, provided a clear margin for insurers to price on. By doing so, the private market created a persistent financial incentive for risk mitigation that achieved tangible environmental benefits, validating decades of economic theory on liability and insurance design.

# Conclusion

This paper provides the first facility-level causal evidence on the impact of transitioning from a flat-fee public UST insurance fund to a risk-rated private market. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages Texas's 1999 policy shift, the analysis demonstrates that forcing firms to bear the expected cost of their environmental risk profile has profound effects. The introduction of risk-based pricing led to an immediate and sustained increase in the closure of high-risk, single-walled tanks. This response was characterized not by market exit, but by technology upgrading, as firms chose to replace their obsolete tanks with safer alternatives. Ultimately, this behavioral change resulted in a substantial and significant reduction in reported environmental leaks.

The success of this price-based mechanism in reducing environmental risk invites a crucial policy comparison. While this study highlights the effectiveness of aligning market incentives with social costs, an important avenue for future work is to contrast this approach with traditional command-and-control regulations. For instance, comparing the effects of risk-based pricing with the impact of vintage-differentiated regulations (VDRs) or direct technology mandates could illuminate the relative cost-effectiveness and efficiency of these different policy instruments @shavell_chapter_2007. Such analysis would provide regulators with a more complete understanding of the optimal policy mix for managing the significant environmental hazards posed by aging infrastructure in the U.S. and beyond.

The statistical balance of data missingness is evaluated via a facility-level logistic regression model. Let $M_i$ denote a binary indicator equal to 1 if facility $i$ is excluded due to a missing tank installation or closure date, and 0 otherwise. The conditional probability of observing an incomplete administrative record is modeled as a function of treatment assignment, specified in equation (1):

$$
 \Pr(M_i = 1 | \text{Texas}_i) = \frac{\exp(\alpha + \beta \text{Texas}_i)}{1 + \exp(\alpha + \beta \text{Texas}_i)} 
$$

where $\text{Texas}_i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if facility $i$ is located in the treatment state, and 0 if located in a control state. The coefficient of interest, $\beta$, captures the log-odds of data attrition for treated facilities relative to controls. The maximum likelihood estimation yields a statistically insignificant coefficient on the treatment indicator ($p = 0.5361$). This result confirms the null hypothesis that $ \beta = 0 $, establishing that the probability of exclusion is orthogonal to the regulatory mandate and satisfying the requisite identifying assumption for the primary difference-in-differences estimator.
