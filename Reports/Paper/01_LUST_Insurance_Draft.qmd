  Public trust funds in thirty-eight U.S. states insure underground storage tank (UST) leaks at a uniform flat fee, even though leak risk varies widely with observable traits such as tank age and wall construction. This paper quantifies how replacing flat-fee pooling with actuarially priced coverage changes firm behavior and environmental outcomes. I exploit Texas’s 1999 closure of its trust fund, which forced all owners into a private market that sets premiums according to facility risk. A facility-year panel covering 1990–2021 links EPA inventories with administrative microdata for Texas and eighteen control states that retained public funds. Difference-in-differences and event-study estimates show that, among single-wall tanks installed before 1999, risk-rated premiums increased annual closure rates by two to three percentage points, shifted closures from market exit to on-site replacement with safer equipment, and reduced the probability of a reported leak by about one percentage point, nearly the entire pre-policy baseline for this high-risk group.  The findings provide the first causal micro-evidence that cost-based environmental liability insurance can internalize pollution risk more effectively than uniform public pooling, offering clear guidance for states that are reconsidering the structure of UST insurance programs.

# Introduction

Underground storage tanks holding motor fuels and other hazardous liquids sit beneath about half a million U.S. facilities, and leaks from these tanks are the leading documented source of groundwater contamination @epa_underground_2024. Cleanup is costly; median remediation expenses exceed $100 000 per site @marcus_going_2021, and the probability of a release rises sharply with observable characteristics such as tank age and whether the walls are single or double. Despite these predictable differences, thirty-eight states finance remediation through public trust funds that charge every facility the same premium, diluting incentives to invest in safer technology and crowding out private insurers @astswmo_archive.

Economic theory predicts that tying premiums to expected damages should induce firms to internalize environmental risk @shavell_liability_1984; @polinsky_strict_1980, yet empirical tests of this mechanism for USTs are scarce. Michigan’s mid-1990s shift toward private, risk-rated coverage suggested large gains but relied on aggregate counts that could not isolate facility-level responses @yin_can_2011; @yin_risk-based_2011. Whether actuarial pricing disciplines high-risk owners without simply driving them out of the market therefore remains unresolved.

Texas provides a clean natural experiment. In 1999 the state closed its public fund overnight and required all owners to purchase private coverage whose premiums vary with observable risk. I assemble a new facility-year panel covering 1990 to 2021 that links EPA inventories with administrative microdata from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and comparable data from eighteen control states that retained trust funds. A difference-in-differences design compares Texas with these fund states, and an event-study variant confirms parallel pre-trends.

Three main results emerge. First, among single-wall tanks installed before 1999, risk-based pricing raised annual closure probabilities by roughly two to three percentage points and shifted closures from outright exit to on-site replacement with safer equipment. Second, the probability of a reported leak fell by about one percentage point, nearly the entire pre-policy baseline for this high-risk group. Third, the effect on leak rates is concentrated among facilities that were already high-risk before the policy change, suggesting that cost-based pricing effectively targets riskier firms. By providing the first causal micro-evidence that actuarially priced environmental liability insurance changes firm behavior in hazardous industries, the paper speaks directly to current policy debates over the future of state UST funds.

**Related Literature**



A well-established body of theoretical work suggests that strict liability rules can be an effective policy instrument for environmental risks, particularly when paired with insurance contracts that align a firm's private incentives with social costs (@shavell_liability_1984, @shavell_model_1984, @shavell_liability_1982, @polinsky_strict_1980, @boyd_retroactive_1997, @shavell_chapter_2007). A crucial condition for this alignment is the insurer's ability to accurately price the risk of environmental harm. This paper provides the first empirical test of this principle in the context of environmental liability, offering causal estimates of how firms respond to a transition from flat-fee to more efficient, cost-based insurance contracts.

The challenge of pricing environmental risk connects this study to the broader economics literature on insurance and selection markets. Specifically, this paper builds on work examining the effects of cost-based pricing and contract design on market outcomes and participant behavior (@de_janvry_supply-_2010, @mcwilliams_new_2012, @einav_contract_2012, @einav_impact_2013, @brown_how_2014, @liberman_equilibrium_2018, @nelson_private_2025, @einav_io_2021). By studying the transition to risk-based premiums for environmental liability, this research contributes new evidence on how mispriced insurance can distort markets, particularly in hazardous industries where the social costs of pollution are significant.


This paper also contributes to the literature on U.S. UST policy. While much of the existing work focuses on estimating the marginal damages of pollution from leaks (@marcus_going_2021, @zabel_hedonic_2012, @guignet_sell_2014, @guignet_impacts_2018, @guignet_contamination_2018, @walsh_contaminated_2017, @guignet_what_2013), this study is complementary, examining the design of management policies intended to prevent those damages.

This research is most closely related to studies of a similar insurance market reform in Michigan by @yin_can_2011, @yin_risk-based_2011, and @yin_environmental_2007. That body of work finds that transitioning to risk-based insurance reduced the number of small firms and reported leaks. However, those analyses relied on aggregate or cross-sectional data, which cannot control for unobserved facility-level heterogeneity and may be susceptible to omitted variable bias.This research is most closely related to studies of a similar insurance market reform in Michigan by @yin_can_2011, @yin_risk-based_2011, and @yin_environmental_2007.

This paper advances on prior work by adopting an empirical strategy similar to other modern studies of environmental liability (@boomhower_drilling_2019). By using a rich, facility-level panel dataset, I can implement difference-in-differences models that control for unobserved facility characteristics and common time shocks, providing more credible causal estimates of how firms adjust their technology, replacement, and exit decisions in response to cost-based pricing.

# Institutional Background

##  Underground Storage Tanks: Physical Characteristics and Environmental Risk

The construction technology of a UST system is the primary determinant of its
environmental risk profile and the observable margin on which actuarial pricing
differentiates. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines a UST system as
any tank and connected underground piping with at least 10% of its volume below
the surface [@epa_underground_2024]. The critical physical distinction within this capital
stock is between single-walled systems, bare steel or fiberglass shells with no
interstitial containment layer, and double-walled systems, which incorporate a
secondary wall and continuous interstitial monitoring space. This construction
choice is economically consequential at the point of installation and is
effectively irreversible thereafter. In Texas, from 1998 to 2021, only 0.003%
of active facilities ever retrofitted tank construction prior to terminal
closure, confirming that investment decisions are concentrated at the extensive
margins of initial installation and final exit. A facility's wall type is
therefore a fixed, observable, and verifiable risk characteristic, precisely the
conditions required for an actuarially feasible pricing margin.

Single-walled construction is cheaper to install but exhibits substantially
higher failure rates than double-walled alternatives. Historical industry
surveys document a persistent price differential: a 1987 GAO survey priced a
standard 10,000-gallon single-walled unit at approximately \$23,000 versus
\$39,000 for a comparable double-walled unit, a 67% premium that contemporaneous
manufacturer filings confirm has persisted [@gao1987; @csi2021; @xerxes2018].
This cost-safety trade-off is borne out empirically in the cross-validation
estimates reported in Section [INSERT]: single-walled tanks exhibit a higher
probability of a confirmed release than double-walled tanks at every age bracket,
with the hazard gap widening after 15 years of operation. The existence of this
predictable, observable, and quantifiable risk differential is what makes
risk-based pricing both technically feasible for a private underwriter and
potentially welfare-improving relative to a uniform-premium public fund.

##  The Federal Regulatory Framework and the 1998 Upgrade Deadline

Federal regulation of USTs originates in the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments (HSWA) to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which directed
the EPA to establish comprehensive technical and financial standards for tank
systems. The EPA finalized these technical standards in 40 CFR Part 280 in 1988,
requiring all non-compliant tanks, those lacking corrosion protection, spill and
overfill controls, and release detection, to be upgraded, replaced, or closed by
a uniform federal compliance deadline of December 22, 1998 [@us_epa_milestones_2021;
@EPA2017USTCompendium]. In the years immediately preceding this deadline, the
average annual facility-level closure rate reached [INSERT]% (SE = [INSERT]),
reflecting a large-scale, industry-wide retirement of the oldest and most
non-compliant portion of the capital stock. Following the deadline, the closure
rate fell to [INSERT]% per year (SE = [INSERT]), producing a persistently aging
legacy fleet. In 1994, single-walled tanks constituted [INSERT]% of the active
stock; by 2019, this share had declined only to [INSERT]%, with the average
active tank age increasing from [INSERT] years in 1994 to [INSERT] years in 2019.
This post-deadline slowdown in capital turnover is an institutional feature of
the stock the empirical analysis examines, and the December 22, 1998 federal
mandate date is directly relevant to the identification strategy for reasons
described in Section 2.4.

##  Financial Responsibility and the State Trust Fund Regime

The 1988 Financial Responsibility Rule (40 CFR Part 280, Subpart H) mandates
that every UST owner demonstrate the financial capacity to fund corrective action
and satisfy third-party liability claims, with minimum required coverage of \$1
million per occurrence [@noauthor_dollars_2018]. In the late 1980s, the nascent
private environmental insurance market was unable to supply this coverage at
affordable cost to the population of small, single-site operators that constitute
the majority of UST owners. To prevent widespread non-compliance, many states
established public trust funds financed by annual tank registration fees or fuel
tax revenues, functioning as a publicly administered insurer of last resort. A
defining feature of these funds is their premium structure: annual fees are set
on a uniform, per-tank basis, invariant to any observable facility risk
characteristic such as wall type, tank age, or leak detection technology. States
retaining public funds consistently report that these funds cover 90% to 100% of
all active facilities, as documented by the Association of State and Territorial
Solid Waste Management Officials [@astswmo_tank_surveys]. This near-complete
market saturation is the predicted equilibrium outcome: because the subsidized
uniform-premium contract is priced below any risk-differentiated private
alternative for high-risk facilities, private insurers are structurally unable to
compete for the portion of the market with above-average risk. The resulting
uniform-premium pooling equilibrium is the institutional baseline against which
Texas's transition is evaluated.

##  Texas's Policy Transition: Treatment Exogeneity

Texas's departure from the public fund model constitutes a sharp,
administratively determined policy discontinuity whose timing was driven by
fiscal insolvency rather than any observable change in the statewide distribution
of facility-level risk. Texas established the Petroleum Storage Tank Remediation
Fund (PSTRF) in 1989 under the Texas Water Code. By 1995, actuarial assessments
confirmed that the fund's liabilities, driven by the accumulating backlog of
legacy remediation claims, were structurally unsustainable. In response, the
74th Texas Legislature enacted House Bill 2587, which mandated the sunset of the
PSTRF [@HB2587_analysis_1995]. The legislature set the fund closure cutoff at
December 22, 1998, the same calendar date as the federal EPA upgrade deadline
codified in 40 CFR §280.21. The alignment of these two dates is not coincidental:
the legislature explicitly selected the federal mandate date as the administrative
anchor for the PSTRF cutoff, ensuring the fund would cease accepting new claims
at precisely the moment when the largest cohort of non-compliant tanks was
required to be addressed [@TexWaterCode_26_3512]. Effective December 22, 1998,
all Texas UST owners were required to secure private insurance or qualify for
self-insurance by demonstrating sufficient financial assets.

Texas's transition to private financial responsibility was preceded by a separate
regulatory regime that is central to the identification strategy. Under 30 TAC
Chapter 334, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission implemented a
staggered upgrade schedule for pre-1988 underground storage tanks, assigning
compliance deadlines by tank vintage cohort that ran from December 22, 1989
through December 22, 1993 (@tbl-mandate-schedule). Owners of the oldest
tanks, those installed before 1965, faced a deadline nine years before the
federal standard; owners of tanks installed between 1985 and 1988 faced a
deadline five years before the federal standard. These mandates required cathodic
protection installation, leak detection equipment, and site assessments, and
carried enforcement authority including facility closure for noncompliance. No
analogous staggered state mandate existed in any of the nineteen control states
during this period; control state pre-1988 facilities faced only the uniform
federal December 22, 1998 deadline.

The economic significance of this staggered schedule for identification is
twofold. First, it created a mechanical wave of compliance-induced closures among
Texas pre-1988 facilities between 1989 and 1993 with no counterpart among
control state facilities during the same years. Facilities facing an imminent
upgrade deadline confronted a discrete make-or-upgrade decision: invest in
required cathodic protection and leak detection systems, or permanently close the
tank. This decision is structurally identical to the closure margin targeted by
the insurance reform and contaminates any pre-trend comparison that pools
pre-1988 Texas and control facilities across the 1989--1998 window. A Wald test
of joint pre-period coefficient nullity on the pooled sample confirms this
contamination, rejecting parallel pre-trends at the $10^{-16}$ level ($F = 17.14$,
$p < 0.001$, clustered at the state level). Second, the phased mandate
fundamentally altered the composition of the surviving Texas pre-1988 tank stock
by December 1998. The tanks still active as of the insurance reform cutoff
represent the subset whose operators had already decided, when confronted with a
compliance deadline between 1989 and 1993, to invest in upgrades rather than
close. This survivor selection is documented in @tbl-mandate-exposure: Texas
pre-1988 tanks active at the treatment date had been past their cohort-specific
compliance deadlines for a mean of 6.2 years (SD = 1.2), while control state
pre-1988 tanks had zero years past any comparable deadline.

The primary identification sample is therefore restricted to facilities whose
entire tank stock was installed after December 22, 1988 (the post-1988 cohort,
hereafter Spec A). Post-1988 tanks were subject to federal technical standards
from installation and were never exposed to the Texas phased upgrade schedule.
Their operators faced the insurance reform as a new and unanticipated financial
liability shock, without any contemporaneous mandate-related make-or-upgrade
decision. The parallel pre-trends test for the Spec A sample fails to reject the
null of parallel pre-trends ($F =$ [INSERT], $p =$ [INSERT]), supporting the
identifying assumption for this subsample. This dual determination of the PSTRF
cutoff date, combined with the restriction to the mandate-free post-1988 cohort,
provides the institutional foundation for the identifying assumption that the
policy transition is orthogonal to facility-level pre-treatment trends. The
empirical corroboration is documented in Section 3.7.

##  The Post-Transition Private Market in Texas

The private insurance market that absorbed the Texas UST population after
December 1998 prices observable facility risk directly, generating the
cross-sectional and intertemporal premium variation that identifies firm
behavioral responses. From 2007 to 2021, the period for which granular financial
responsibility administrative data are available from the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ), an average of 89.8% of active retail UST
facilities in Texas satisfied their financial responsibility obligation through
commercial private insurance. The remaining 10.2% relied on self-insurance
mechanisms, available exclusively to large, financially capitalized owners who
can satisfy stringent asset tests. The private market is dominated by a small
number of specialist environmental insurers; Mid-Continent Casualty Company
(NAIC 23418) operated as the primary underwriter for Texas UST risks throughout
this period. Its actuarial rate filings, obtained from the System for Electronic
Rates and Forms Filing (SERFF) for the periods 2006--2014, 2014--2019,
2019--2021, and 2021 onward, provide the rating algorithm underlying the premium
reconstruction described in Section [INSERT]. A key structural feature confirmed
in these rate filings is that premiums are a strictly increasing function of tank
age and a strictly positive function of single-walled construction, while the
per-tank rate is invariant to facility size. This pricing structure means that a
Texas owner of an aging single-walled tank faces a marginal cost of continued
operation that increases deterministically over time, the mechanism the dynamic
model in Section [INSERT] formalizes.

##  Control Group Definition and Institutional Restrictions

The control group comprises [INSERT] states that retained public uniform-premium
trust funds continuously throughout the study window of 1985 to 2020, subject to
three institutional complications that require explicit treatment. First, New
Jersey enacted a private insurance mandate effective May 19, 2003 (N.J.A.C.
7:14B-15.1), effectively becoming a treated unit after that date. New Jersey is
therefore excluded from the control group entirely, rather than restricted to
pre-2003 observations, to avoid contaminating the control pool with a state
undergoing a similar policy transition. Second, Tennessee did not establish an
operational state trust fund until July 1, 2008 (Public Chapter 794). Prior to
that date, Tennessee UST owners operated under a private insurance environment
analogous to post-transition Texas. A diagnostic analysis of Tennessee's LUST
reporting confirms zero confirmed leaks recorded in the administrative data across
all years in the analysis window, consistent with an institutional artifact in
which LUST reporting was administratively tied to fund participation. Tennessee
is therefore excluded from all leak-outcome specifications. Third, Maryland has
never operated a state financial assurance fund [@astswmo_tank_surveys]. Maryland
is retained in the analysis sample but flagged for robustness checks in which it
is excluded, reported in Appendix [INSERT]. With these three restrictions applied,
[INSERT] states provide the valid uniform-premium counterfactual against which
Texas's behavioral response is identified.

#  Data

##  Panel Architecture and Source Layers

The empirical analysis rests on a facility-year panel constructed by
horizontally merging three distinct administrative data layers. The first layer
is the behavioral backbone: a harmonized facility-year panel compiled from raw
state-level UST administrative inventories and EPA summary files covering Texas
and the [INSERT] control states from 1985 through 2020. This layer records, for
each facility-year, the occurrence of tank closures, market exits, system
retrofits, and confirmed leak incidents. The second layer is a tank-level
physical inventory recording the installation date, closure date, wall
construction type, capacity, fuel type, and current operational status for every
individual tank associated with each facility. The third layer comprises
financial data: private insurance premium estimates for Texas facilities,
reconstructed from actuarial rate filings, and realized cleanup cost records for
a subset of control states. The unit of observation throughout is the
facility-year, and a unique panel identifier constructed from the
state-standardized facility code and two-letter state abbreviation serves as the
merge key across all three layers.

##  Sample Construction and Attrition

I construct the estimation sample through four sequential filters, each
motivated by a distinct identification requirement. @tbl-attrition reports the
facility count and facility-year count remaining at each stage.

The first filter restricts the panel to the study window of 1985 through 2020,
the interval over which administrative data coverage is sufficiently continuous
across both the treated and control states to support pre-trend estimation and
post-treatment tracking. The second filter restricts the sample to Texas and
the [INSERT] control states defined in Section 2.6, having already excluded New
Jersey as a treated unit and applied the Tennessee and Maryland institutional
restrictions described there.

The third filter retains only incumbent facilities, defined as those first
observed in the administrative records prior to the December 22, 1998 statutory
treatment date. This restriction serves two purposes: it ensures that all
facilities in the analysis sample faced the policy shock as an unanticipated
constraint rather than an entry condition, and it eliminates any post-announcement
compositional change in the market that would otherwise confound the treatment
effect estimates.

The fourth filter excludes facilities for which critical tank-level date records
are missing. A facility is excluded if any of its constituent tanks lacks an
installation date, or if any tank recorded as closed lacks a closure date. This
exclusion is applied at the facility level rather than the tank level because
a missing date on a single tank would otherwise silently contaminate the closure
timing and age-at-closure variables for the entire facility. The scale and
distributional balance of this exclusion across the Texas and control groups are
reported in @tbl-missing-balance. I estimate a logistic regression of the
missing-date indicator on the Texas treatment indicator to test for differential
attrition. The resulting balance test yields $p =$ [INSERT], [INSERT: confirming
balance or flagging imbalance and directing reader to IPW robustness in
Appendix B.4].

## Primary Outcome Variables

Three binary outcome variables are constructed at the facility-year level from
the behavioral backbone. The primary outcome, $\text{Closure}_{it}$, equals one
if facility $i$ recorded at least one tank closure event in calendar year $t$.
Among facility-years in which $\text{Closure}_{it} = 1$, I construct two
mutually exclusive conditional outcomes: $\text{Exit} \mid \text{Closure}_{it}$,
equal to one if the facility permanently exited the market in year $t$, and
$\text{Replace} \mid \text{Closure}_{it}$, equal to one if the facility closed a
tank but remained operational, implying on-site replacement. The environmental
outcome, $\text{Leak}_{it}$, equals one if facility $i$ reported a confirmed
release to state regulators in year $t$, drawn from the harmonized Leaking
Underground Storage Tank (LUST) incident records. I additionally construct a
count variable recording the total number of confirmed releases per facility-year,
expressed per 1,000 facility-years for descriptive reporting. All outcome
variables are defined at the facility-year level by aggregating the underlying
monthly records to an annual frequency.

For the event study specifications, I define relative event time as
$k = \text{year} - 1998$, indexed to the statutory treatment year such that
$k = 0$ corresponds to calendar year 1998, $k = -1$ is the omitted baseline
category, and post-treatment effects are identified for $k \geq 1$. The event
study window spans 1985 to 2018, yielding a maximum of [INSERT] pre-treatment
periods and [INSERT] post-treatment periods.

##  The 1998 Cross-Section and Tank-Level Stock Variables

I construct a cross-sectional snapshot of the active tank stock as of December
22, 1998 by retaining all tanks that satisfy two conditions: an installation date
on or before December 22, 1998, and a closure date either missing or strictly
after December 22, 1998. This cross-section records the physical characteristics
of the capital stock at the moment of the policy shock and serves two functions.
First, it supplies the stock-level covariates, including tank age as of the
treatment date and wall construction type, that enter the regression
specifications as controls and define the main analysis subsamples. Tank age as
of the treatment date is computed as the elapsed time between installation date
and December 22, 1998, expressed in years. Second, it provides the basis for the
1998 summary statistics reported in Panel A of @tbl-descriptive.

The pre-1988 vintage indicator equals one for tanks installed on or before
December 22, 1988, the federal mandate cutoff codified in 40 CFR §280.21. This
cutoff defines the Spec B subsample used in supplementary estimates: the
pre-1988 single-walled cohort that carried the highest observable risk but whose
pre-period trends are contaminated by the Texas phased mandate. The primary
estimation sample (Spec A) is restricted to facilities whose entire tank stock
was installed after December 22, 1988, comprising 33,760 facilities at the
treatment date. The Texas phased mandate schedule, which imposed earlier
compliance deadlines on pre-1988 tanks according to their installation vintage
under 30 TAC Chapter 334, is documented in @tbl-mandate-schedule. I assign each
pre-1988 Texas tank its cohort-specific mandate deadline and compute years past
the applicable deadline as of December 22, 1998, the mandate exposure variable
reported in @tbl-mandate-exposure.

##  Private Insurance Premium Reconstruction

Private insurers do not publicly disclose individual policy premiums. I
reconstruct the premium schedule that Texas facilities faced in the
post-transition period by building a bottom-up actuarial rating engine from the
rate filings of Mid-Continent Casualty Company (NAIC 23418). I obtain rate
manuals filed with the System for Electronic Rates and Forms Filing (SERFF)
covering four regulatory periods: 2006--2014, 2014--2019, 2019--2021, and 2021
onward. These filings provide the complete pricing algorithm, including base
rates, Increased Limit Factors (ILF), and all secondary risk loads applied to
observable facility characteristics.

I estimate the monthly premium $P_{ijt}$ for tank $j$ at facility $i$ in month
$t$ as:

$$
P_{ijt} = \text{Base}_{t} \times \text{ILF}_{it} \times
\left(1 + \sum_{k} \lambda_{k,t} \mathbf{X}_{ijt}\right)
$$

where $\text{Base}_{t}$ is the per-tank base rate active in filing period $t$,
$\text{ILF}_{it}$ is the Increased Limit Factor adjusting for the elected
coverage limit, defaulting to the statutory \$1 million per occurrence minimum
where unspecified, and $\mathbf{X}_{ijt}$ is a vector of observable risk
characteristics including tank age bin, wall construction type, piping type, and
installed leak detection technology. The parameters $\lambda_{k,t}$ are the
secondary risk loads, additive percentage credits or debits, assigned to each
characteristic in filing period $t$.

Three implementation assumptions are required. First, I hold the base rate
constant within each filing period at its filed value, consistent with the
filing terms. Second, for risk characteristics unobserved in the administrative
records, including aquifer proximity and flood zone classification, I set the
corresponding risk load to zero, yielding a conservative estimate of the true
premium. Third, the rate filings permit underwriters to apply schedule rating
adjustments of $\pm$40% at their discretion; I use the base manual premium as
the price signal and treat discretionary adjustments as mean-zero errors across
the population, an assumption evaluated against the distribution of observed
financial responsibility filings in the TCEQ records.

Granular premium microdata are available beginning in 2006. The period from
January 1999 through December 2005 represents a transition window in which the
private market was operational but individual premium records are not observed.
For this window, I assume stationarity of the conditional premium distribution
relative to the 2006 filing period and apply an aggregate inflation deflator to
recover real premium levels. This imputation implies that the structural
estimates of price sensitivity $\gamma_{\text{price}}$ in Section [INSERT] are
identified primarily from post-2006 variation; robustness to the 1999--2005
imputation is evaluated in Appendix [INSERT].

##  Cleanup Cost Distribution for the Control Group

The control group operates under a uniform-premium public fund regime in which
remediation costs are realized ex-post rather than priced ex-ante. To
parameterize the severity of environmental failure, the term $L(x_t)$ in the
structural model of Section [INSERT], I link the administrative facility
identifiers to the payment ledgers of state trust funds in Colorado, Louisiana,
New Mexico, Tennessee, and Utah [@noauthor_petroleum_nodate;
@noauthor_underground_nodate]. This five-state subset provides the empirical
distribution of realized cleanup costs conditional on a confirmed release. All
cost figures are deflated to 2023 dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics
CPI for urban consumers. The realized cost distribution is characterized by
extreme positive skewness and rejects normality in favor of a heavy-tailed
log-normal structure. The median cleanup cost represents the typical remediation
event, while the mean is elevated by a small number of catastrophic outcomes in
which contamination plumes migrate off-site and trigger third-party liability.
This heavy tail is a structural feature of UST liability rather than an artifact
of specific state administrative procedures: the upper tail of the cost
distribution is consistent across all five sampled fund states, as documented
in @fig-cost-distribution. For control states without verifiable claims data, I
extrapolate the conditional cost function from the five-state sample using
observable facility characteristics as predictors and assume stationarity of the
cost distribution over time within each state, adjusting for aggregate inflation.

## Descriptive Statistics

@tbl-descriptive reports summary statistics in two panels. Panel A characterizes
the 1998 cross-section of active tanks as of the treatment date, separately for
Texas and the control group. Panel B reports pre-period flow averages over 1989
to 1997, stratified by installation cohort to document the distinct pre-period
dynamics of the Spec A (post-1988) and Spec B (pre-1988) subsamples. Calendar
year 1998 is excluded from the Panel B calculations to avoid contamination from
anticipatory behavior in the final pre-treatment year.

Panel A documents the comparability of the capital stock on the treatment date.
In Texas, 22,192 active facilities held 61,782 tanks with a mean age of 15.6
years (SD = 11.2); 76.3% were installed before December 22, 1988, and 86.7%
were single-walled. The corresponding figures for the control group are 77,068
facilities, 214,948 tanks, mean age 14.9 years (SD = 10.8), 64.5% pre-1988
vintage, and 69.3% single-walled. Both groups average 2.8 tanks per facility.
The higher pre-1988 share in Texas reflects survivor selection from the phased
mandate: Texas pre-1988 tanks active at December 22, 1998 had already cleared a
cohort-specific compliance hurdle between 1989 and 1993, whereas control state
pre-1988 tanks were encountering their first compliance deadline simultaneously
with the insurance reform.

Panel B documents pre-period behavioral patterns separately for the Spec A
(post-1988 only), Spec B (pre-1988 only), and mixed cohort subsamples. The
contrast between the Spec A and Spec B rows is direct evidence of the mandate
confound. Among Spec A facilities, pre-period closure rates are nearly identical
across Texas ([INSERT]%) and the control group ([INSERT]%), consistent with the
parallel trends established in @fig-pretrend-closure. Among Spec B facilities,
the control group exhibits a higher pre-period closure rate than Texas ([INSERT]%
vs. [INSERT]%), reflecting the Texas phased mandate's prior exhaustion of the
highest-risk and most closure-prone pre-1988 tanks. Operators who chose closure
over compliance upgrades between 1989 and 1993 left behind a surviving Texas
pre-1988 stock that is, by construction, more durable than its control-state
counterpart at the same point in calendar time. This survivor-selection gap is
the mechanical pre-trend violation documented formally in @tbl-pt-validation
and confirms that valid identification requires either restricting to the Spec A
sample or controlling for cohort-specific mandate dynamics in Spec B
specifications.

The leak incidence rates in Panel B reinforce this interpretation. For the Spec
A cohort, pre-period leak incidence is [INSERT] per 1,000 facility-years in
Texas and [INSERT] per 1,000 in the control group. For the Spec B cohort, Texas
pre-period leak incidence is [INSERT] per 1,000 versus [INSERT] per 1,000 in the
control group, with the direction of the gap [INSERT: describe].

## Financial Responsibility and the Insurance Regime

To mitigate the liability associated with these environmental risks, the EPA's 1988 Financial Responsibility Rule (40 CFR Part 280, Subpart H) mandates that owners secure coverage for corrective action and third-party liability, typically $1 million per occurrence. In the late 1980s, the immaturity of the private environmental insurance market led many states to establish public trust funds. These funds typically operate on a flat-fee basis, charging uniform premiums regardless of facility-specific risk. While effective at ensuring solvency, this pooling mechanism creates a price externality that distorts incentives for risk mitigation. In states retaining such funds, they consistently cover 90% to 100% of facilities.

Texas initially utilized a public fund model but diverged in 1998 following the passage of House Bill 2587. Facing actuarial insolvency, the legislature sunset the Texas Petroleum Storage Tank Remediation Fund, forcing the entire facility population to migrate to the private market or self-insure by 1999. This sharp policy discontinuity serves as the central identification strategy. In the post-transition period (2007–2021), 89.8% of Texas retail facilities met their obligations through private insurance, with the remainder relying on self-insurance mechanisms available only to highly capitalized firms.

# Conceptual Framework: Insurance Design and Optimal Stopping

The facility owner's decision is modeled as a single-agent dynamic discrete choice problem following the optimal stopping literature (Rust, 1987). In an infinite horizon setting with time indexed by $t$, the agent operates a single underground storage tank (UST) and observes the state variable $a_t$, representing the tank's age. At the beginning of each period, the agent chooses a binary action $d_t \in \{ \text{Maintain}, \text{Close} \}$ to maximize the expected present discounted value of future payoffs. If the agent chooses to close ($d_t = \text{Close}$), the facility exits the market permanently, receiving a terminal scrap value $\kappa$ representing the liquidity of the land net of decommissioning costs. Conditional on maintenance ($d_t = \text{Maintain}$), the flow utility is specified as $u(a_t) = R - P_j(a_t)$, where $R$ denotes the annual net revenue from operations less all non-insurance costs, and $P_j(a_t)$ is the insurance premium under regime $j$. While the structural estimation in Section 5 relaxes this assumption to incorporate deductibles and partial risk internalization, this simplified framework assumes full insurance coverage for tractability, treating environmental risk solely as an ex-ante premium cost rather than an ex-post liability shock. The agent’s value function $V(a)$ satisfies the Bellman equation:

$$
V(a) = \max \left\{ R - P_j(a) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(a') \mid a], \kappa \right\}
$$

where $\beta \in (0, 1)$ is the discount factor and the expectation is taken over the stochastic evolution of tank age. The optimal stopping rule dictates that the firm closes the tank when the continuation value of operation falls below the scrap value $\kappa$.

The divergence in firm behavior across states is driven by the elasticity of the premium function $P_j(a)$ with respect to capital depreciation. Under the **Uniform Premium (Public Fund)** regime, the price is invariant to risk, such that $P(a) = \bar{P}$ and the marginal cost of aging is zero ($\frac{\partial P}{\partial a} = 0$). This flat pricing structure eliminates the financial incentive to retire aging capital, pivoting the continuation value curve upward and causing the firm to retain the asset until it is physically obsolete, defined as age $a^*_{UP}$. Conversely, under the **Risk-Based (Private Market)** regime, premiums are strictly increasing in the leak hazard rate $h(a)$, such that $\frac{\partial P}{\partial a} > 0$. This introduces a positive marginal cost of aging, pivoting the value function downward for older tanks and accelerating the optimal exit age to $a^*_{RB}$. Figure 1 illustrates this mechanism, demonstrating that the introduction of risk-based pricing strictly reduces the optimal tank lifespan relative to the uniform pricing baseline ($a^*_{RB} < a^*_{UP}$).

![The Mechanism: Optimal Stopping under Alternative Insurance Regimes](Output/Figures/Paper/Fig_1_Mechanism.pdf){#fig-mechanism width=90%}

While risk-based pricing improves allocative efficiency by penalizing higher failure rates, it does not achieve the first-best social optimum due to unpriced health externalities. The social planner’s objective function includes both the remediation costs ($L$) covered by insurers and the health damages ($E$) from groundwater contamination, which are typically unobservable and generate no third-party claims (Marcus, 2021). Consequently, the private actuarial premium $P_{RB} \propto h(a)L$ is strictly less than the social marginal cost $h(a)(L+E)$. This wedge implies that while the private market induces earlier exit than the public fund, the equilibrium exit age $a^*_{RB}$ remains higher than the socially optimal age $a^*_{SOC}$. Figure 2 visualizes this welfare loss, identifying the shaded region between $a^*_{SOC}$ and $a^*_{RB}$ as the uninternalized externality. The theoretical prediction for the empirical analysis is therefore a monotonic ordering of tank lifespans where $a^*_{SOC} < a^*_{RB} < a^*_{UP}$.

## Data and Sample Construction {#sec-data}

The empirical analysis relies on a composite panel constructed from three distinct layers of administrative microdata. These layers comprise a comprehensive facility-level backbone covering the universe of regulated entities, a market-based premium overlay for the treated jurisdiction of Texas, and a claims-cost overlay for a subset of control states.

### The Administrative Backbone

The core dataset consists of the universe of regulated UST facilities in Texas and eighteen control states, harmonized from raw state-level administrative inventories and EPA summary files. The panel tracks facility lifecycles from initial registration through 2023. For every facility-month observation, I observe the exact timing of critical behavioral outcomes including tank closures, system retrofits, and confirmed releases. As shown in the gray intervals of @fig-d1 (Panel B), this administrative backbone is continuous across the 1999 policy intervention window for all sampled states. This continuity ensures that the primary outcome variables ($Y_{it}$) are measured consistently before and after the treatment.

\small _Note:_    Notes: Gray bars in Panel B represent the 'Admin Data' backbone (facility entry/exit/leaks) available for all analysis states. Colored overlays indicate periods where cost data is available: Orange for Texas Market Premiums (starting 2006), and Blue for cleanup costs in select control states. The gaps illustrate the data matching challenge.

### Premium Reconstruction and Rating Engine Dynamics

To parameterize the structural model, I reconstruct the private insurance premiums that Texas facilities faced following the 1999 privatization. Because private insurers do not publicly disclose individual policy premiums, I build a "bottom-up" rating engine based on the actuarial filings of the Mid-Continent Casualty Company, a dominant insurer in the Texas UST market. Using rate manuals obtained from the System for Electronic Rates & Forms Filing (SERFF) covering 2006 through 2021, I recover the precise algorithms used to price tank risk. I estimate the monthly premium $P_{ijt}$ for tank $j$ at facility $i$ in month $t$ using the insurer's canonical pricing formula:

$$
P_{ijt} = \text{Base}_{t} \times \text{ILF}_{it} \times \left( 1 + \sum_{k} \lambda_{k,t} \mathbf{X}_{ijt} \right)
$$

The resulting pricing engine exhibits four distinct structural properties verified in the rate filings. First, the insurer prices depreciation through a discrete step function rather than a linear trend. As shown in @fig-age-steps, premiums remain relatively flat for new capital but ratchet up significantly as tanks cross specific actuarial age thresholds (e.g., 20 and 30 years), creating non-linear incentives for replacement.

::: {#fig-age-steps layout-nrow="1" layout-ncol="1"}

![](Output/Figures/FD02a_engine_age_steps.png){ fig-align="center" width="80%"}

\small _Note:_    The solid line represents the mean per-tank premium calculated by the actuarial engine for each integer age (0–40 years). The discrete steps correspond to the age bins defined in the Mid-Continent rate filings (e.g., 0–5, 6–10, 11–15). The gray bars (right axis) show the distribution of tank ages in the Texas sample, indicating that a significant portion of the fleet is in the older, higher-priced age brackets.

:::

Second, conditional on age, the construction technology dictates the base risk load. @fig-risk-loads illustrates the additive premium surcharges applied to single-walled and steel systems. Single-walled tanks face substantial penalties independent of their age, reflecting the insurer's assessment of their inherent structural vulnerability.

::: {#fig-risk-loads layout-nrow="1" layout-ncol="1"}

:::

Third, the market structure suggests constant returns to scale regarding liability. As demonstrated in @fig-scale-check, the rating engine applies no volume discounts; the per-tank premium remains invariant to the number of tanks at a facility. This implies that larger facilities face a linear cost function with respect to their capital stock size.

::: {#fig-scale-check layout-nrow="1" layout-ncol="1"}

![](Output/Figures/FD02c_engine_scale_check.png){ fig-align="center" width="80%"}

\small _Note:_    Average per-tank premium plotted against the number of tanks at the facility. The flat trend confirms that the pricing engine aggregates risk linearly (sum of individual tank premiums) without applying bulk discounts for larger facilities. This validates the use of per-tank pricing as the fundamental unit of analysis.

Scale Neutrality Check. Engine Logic: No explicit volume discount (Flat per-unit price expected).

:::

Finally, the insurer actively updates these schedules to reflect evolving risk perceptions. @fig-filing-evolution decomposes the aggregate age curves by regulatory filing era. Over time, the insurer has steepened the penalty for older tanks, particularly in the 2019 and 2021 filings, indicating a learning process where the realized losses from the aging legacy fleet are increasingly priced into the market.

### Addressing Data Gaps

The analysis addresses two specific dimensions of data sparsity visualized in @fig-d1. First, regarding geographic heterogeneity, the cost estimation routine is restricted to control states with verifiable claims data and extrapolated to administrative-only states based on observable facility characteristics. Second, regarding temporal gaps, the administrative backbone extends beyond the cost data windows. Specifically, the period from 1999 to 2005 in Texas represents a transition window where private prices existed but granular microdata is unavailable. For such periods, I assume stationarity in the conditional cost distribution while allowing for aggregate inflation adjustments.


### Cost Data Overlay: Control Group Liability

While the treated group faces ex-ante premium pricing, the control group operates under a public insurance regime where costs are realized ex-post. To parameterize the severity of environmental failure ($C \mid \text{Leak}$) for these facilities, I link administrative facility identifiers to the payment ledgers of state trust funds in Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Utah. This subset provides the empirical distribution of cleanup costs required to model the "state's burden" under the flat-fee regime.

The resulting cost distribution, visualized in @fig-claims-dist, is characterized by extreme positive skewness. The data rejects a normal distribution hypothesis in favor of a heavy-tailed log-normal structure. The distinction between the median and mean cost is economically significant; while the median represents the typical remediation event, the mean is driven upward by catastrophic outliers—rare events where groundwater contamination plumes migrate off-site, triggering liability magnitudes orders of magnitude larger than the modal claim.

The substantial deviation between mean and median illustrates the heavy-tailed nature of environmental liability.

Furthermore, liability exhibits spatial heterogeneity driven by differences in hydrogeology and state-specific remediation standards. @fig-claims-state breaks down these costs by jurisdiction. Although the central tendency (median) varies by state, the dispersion—specifically the reach of the upper tail—remains a consistent feature across all sampled public funds. This confirms that the "catastrophic tail risk" is a fundamental technological property of UST systems rather than an artifact of specific state administrative procedures.

To parameterize the structural model, I overlay financial data onto the administrative backbone as depicted by the colored intervals in @fig-d1. Post-1999, Texas facilities migrated to private insurance where I observe facility-specific premium quotes and coverage terms from the *Mid-Continent Group* rate filings. While the policy shock occurred in 1999, granular premium microdata is only available starting in 2006. The period from 1999 to 2005 represents a transition window where prices existed but are not directly observed in the sample. For the control group, I link facility identifiers to state fund claim records to derive the empirical distribution of cleanup costs conditional on a leak.

The analysis addresses two specific dimensions of data sparsity visualized in @fig-d1. First, regarding geographic heterogeneity, not all control states provide claims transparency. The analysis therefore restricts the cost estimation routine to states with verifiable claims data and extrapolates these cost functions to administrative-only states based on observable facility characteristics such as age, tank capacity, and local geology. Second, regarding temporal gaps, the administrative backbone extends beyond the cost data windows. For periods where cost data is missing, such as the Texas 1999 to 2005 window or pre-1990 control states, I assume stationarity in the conditional cost distribution while allowing for aggregate inflation adjustments. This structure implies that while firm behavior ($Q$) is observed continuously, financial incentives ($P$) are imputed during gap years using the structural parameters recovered from the data-rich windows.

### Facility Risk and Endogenous Detection

The final data layer characterizes the realized environmental performance of the tank capital, specifically how the insurance regime alters the *timing* of leak discovery. I define the annual leak probability using the realized history of Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) incidents reported to state regulators. Aggregating the monthly panel to the facility-year level, I calculate the realized failure rate per effective exposure-year.

Crucially, I distinguish between two mutually exclusive detection mechanisms. **Operational Discovery** refers to releases identified by leak detection equipment (e.g., automatic tank gauging, interstitial monitoring) while the facility is active. **Closure Discovery** refers to releases identified only during the physical removal of the tank system.

@fig-leak-prob reveals a structural shift in detection behavior driven by the insurance regime. In the Control Group (State Funds), a significant proportion of releases are "Found at Closure" (Orange), indicating a passive monitoring environment where leaks accumulate as latent liabilities, hidden until market exit. In contrast, the Texas (Private Insurance) sample exhibits a higher rate of "Operational Discovery" (Blue) and a collapsed rate of closure-found leaks. This shift is consistent with the presence of active insurer monitoring: private underwriters require proof of integrity for coverage, forcing the endogenous detection of leaks that would otherwise remain hidden under the flat-fee regime.

\small _Note:_    Notes: This stacked bar chart displays the unconditional annual probability of a confirmed release for facilities in the analysis sample. The "Operational Discovery" (Blue) component represents leaks detected while the tank was in service. The "Found at Closure" (Orange) component represents leaks detected during tank removal or permanent closure. The height of the bar represents the total annual hazard rate. The shift from "Closure" to "Operational" detection in Texas illustrates the monitoring effect of private insurance.

## Institutional Background and Financial Responsibility Data

**The Rise of Financial Responsibility**
Federal regulation of underground storage tanks began with the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Congress directed the EPA to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for USTs, citing the growing threat of groundwater contamination from leaking petroleum tanks. A central pillar of this framework was the "financial responsibility" mandate. Recognizing that remediation costs often exceeded the assets of small tank owners—potentially leading to bankruptcy and abandoned "orphan" sites—Congress authorized the EPA to require owners to demonstrate the ability to pay for cleanup damages.

In October 1988, the EPA finalized the Financial Responsibility Rule (40 CFR Part 280, Subpart H), requiring all UST owners to secure coverage for corrective action and third-party liability. The mandated coverage minimums were substantial: \$1 million per occurrence for large owners and \$500,000 for smaller owners. Owners could satisfy this requirement through private insurance, self-insurance, surety bonds, or state-administered financial assurance funds. In the late 1980s, the private insurance market was thin and expensive. To prevent widespread non-compliance, many states created public trust funds—financed by tank fees or fuel taxes—to serve as the de facto insurer of last resort.

Texas initially followed this pattern, establishing the Petroleum Storage Tank Remediation Fund in 1989. However, facing insolvency, the Texas legislature mandated the sunset of the fund in 1998 (House Bill 2587). Effective December 1998, the state ceased accepting new claims, compelling the entire UST population to transition to the private insurance market or self-insure by the 1999 deadline. This abrupt policy shock provides the identification strategy for this paper.

**Financial Responsibility Mechanisms and Premium Estimation**
To analyze the impact of this transition, I construct a novel dataset linking facility-level financial choices with estimated private insurance costs. This process involves classifying compliance mechanisms and reconstructing a history of risk-based premiums.

First, I classify the compliance mechanisms. In the eighteen control states, the financial responsibility requirement is met through state-administered public trust funds, which typically charge a flat annual tank fee regardless of risk. I define facilities in these states as "publicly insured." For Texas, I obtain the complete history of financial assurance filings from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) via open records requests. This dataset covers the universe of active facilities from 1999 to 2021. I classify Texas facilities into two groups: those purchasing **private insurance** and those using **self-insurance** or equivalent financial instruments.^[The dataset details the specific compliance mechanism (e.g., commercial insurance, self-insurance, letter of credit) and the financial provider for every active facility-year.]

Second, I reconstruct private insurance premiums. Private insurers do not publicly disclose individual policy premiums. To recover these costs, I build a "bottom-up" rating engine based on the actuarial filings of Mid-Continent Casualty Company, a dominant insurer in the Texas UST market. I digitize rate manuals filed with the Oklahoma Insurance Department (SERFF) covering four regulatory periods (2006–2014, 2014–2019, 2019–2021, and 2021 onwards) to recover the precise algorithms used to price tank risk.^[Rate manuals were obtained from the System for Electronic Rates & Forms Filing (SERFF) for Mid-Continent Casualty Company (NAIC 23418). The filings provide the specific base rates, Increased Limit Factors (ILF), and secondary risk loads for the "Pollution Liability - Underground Storage Tank" program.]

I estimate the monthly premium $P_{ijt}$ for tank $j$ at facility $i$ in month $t$ using the insurer's canonical pricing formula:

$$
P_{ijt} = \text{Base}_{t} \times \text{ILF}_{it} \times \left( 1 + \sum_{k} \lambda_{k,t} \mathbf{X}_{ijt} \right)
$$

where $\text{Base}_{t}$ is the base rate per tank (fixed at \$300 for standard coverage), and $\text{ILF}_{it}$ is the Increased Limit Factor adjusting for coverage limits (defaulting to the statutory \$1M/\$1M limit if unspecified). The term $\mathbf{X}_{ijt}$ is a vector of observable risk characteristics including tank age, wall construction, piping type, and leak detection technology. The parameters $\lambda_{k,t}$ represent the specific "secondary risk loads" (credits or debits) assigned to each characteristic by the insurer's manual in period $t$.^[The risk model includes loads for tank status (e.g., "Temporarily Out of Use"), tank age (e.g., surcharges for tanks >20 years), construction (e.g., credits for double-walled steel), and leak detection (e.g., credits for interstitial monitoring).]

This reconstruction relies on three identifying assumptions. First, consistent with the filings, I hold the base rate constant across the sample period. Second, for risk factors where data is unavailable (e.g., aquifer proximity or flood zones), I set the risk load to zero, yielding a conservative estimate. Third, while underwriters retain discretion to apply schedule rating adjustments (typically $\pm 40\%$), I use the **base manual premium** as the primary measure of the price signal, treating discretionary adjustments as a bounded error term.^[The rate filings explicitly allow for schedule rating adjustments between 0.60 (-40%) and 1.40 (+40%) of the base premium based on underwriter judgment of unobserved risk characteristics. I assume these adjustments average to zero across the population.] This procedure generates a facility-month panel of estimated insurance costs for over 22,000 unique facilities, providing a direct measure of the marginal cost of environmental risk in the private market. -->


# Causal Evidence from the Transition to Private Insurance



This section presents the empirical evidence on the effects of risk-adjusted insurance on UST facilities by analyzing the behavioral responses of incumbent facilities to the transition from flat-fee public insurance to risk-based private market coverage. The analysis focuses on identifying causal effects through comparison of treatment and control states, examining how facilities adjusted their technology adoption, closure decisions, and risk management practices when faced with insurance premiums that reflected their actual environmental risk profile.


<!-- This section presents the empirical evidence on the effects of risk-adjusted insurance on UST facilities and proceeds in two parts. The first part establishes the theoretical and econometric framework for analyzing insurance selection markets, which is necessary for interpreting outcomes when firms can choose their insurance type. This section outlines the economic theory for creating a baseline risk score, stratifying the sample, and using claim rates to test for adverse selection and moral hazard, following the literature on selection markets ( @einav_io_2021 ). It lays the groundwork for a future analysis and does not present results at this time. -->

<!-- 
The second part presents the causal evidence currently available from the main estimation sample, as described in Panel B of @tbl-summary_stats. This analysis addresses three core research questions. First, I test whether cost-based pricing is efficient by examining if observable facility characteristics are systematically correlated with leak risk, which would justify pricing on those margins. Second, I investigate whether UST facilities respond to the price incentives from cost-based pricing by testing if Texas facilities were more likely to close high-risk tanks and whether the nature of that closure (i.e., exit versus replacement) changed post-policy. Finally, I examine whether these behavioral changes had a tangible effect on the environmental externality by testing for a corresponding change in reported leak rates.

## Within Texas Comparison of UST Facility Behavior

This section outlines the empirical framework for a within-Texas analysis designed to test for adverse selection and moral hazard in the post-1999 insurance market. After the policy transition, Texas facilities could choose between private insurance and other mechanisms like self-insurance. This choice is endogenous, as firms selecting into different contracts likely differ systematically in their underlying risk profiles. A simple comparison of outcomes (e.g., leak rates) between these groups would therefore be biased, making it impossible to distinguish whether higher leak rates among the insured are due to riskier firms buying insurance (adverse selection) or insurance coverage itself changing firm behavior (moral hazard).

To isolate the causal effect of insurance coverage and disentangle these channels, I adopt the selection market framework of @einav_io_2021. The core of this strategy is to first control for a facility's baseline risk *before* examining the effects of its insurance choice. To do this, I construct an ex-ante risk score for each facility using only pre-policy data. This score allows me to create comparable treatment (privately insured) and control (self-insured) groups by matching on baseline risk. Within this risk-stratified sample, I can then estimate the causal effect of private insurance using a doubly robust difference-in-differences specification, which allows for clean tests of adverse selection and moral hazard.

Note that this section does not present results; it outlines the theoretical framework and empirical strategy for future analysis. The actual results will be presented in a subsequent section once the necessary data and analyses are complete.


### Testing for Selection and Moral Hazard in the Texas Insurance Market

To disentangle these effects, I adapt the selection market framework of @einav_io_2021. The core of this strategy is to first control for a facility's baseline risk before examining the causal effect of its insurance choice. This requires a multi-step approach: (1) constructing an ex-ante risk score for each facility using only pre-policy data; (2) using this score to test for adverse selection; (3) using risk-stratified comparisons to test for moral hazard; and (4) employing a doubly-robust estimation strategy to quantify the causal effect of private insurance on facility outcomes.

#### Step 1: Constructing a Baseline Risk Score

The first step is to create a single predictive index, $\hat{\theta}_i$, that summarizes each facility's baseline, pre-policy propensity to experience a leak. Following the selection market literature, this scalar risk score serves to project the multi-dimensional, unobserved risk characteristics of a facility onto a single, rankable dimension. To ensure this score is not contaminated by the post-policy insurance choice, it is estimated using only data from the pre-1999 period to predict claims within that same pre-policy period.


Specifically, I estimate a prognostic score using a regression-forest algorithm with 10-fold cross-validation on pre-1999 facility covariates to predict the probability of a claim during the pre-policy period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat\theta_i^{\text{pre}} &= \widehat{P}(\text{claim}_{i,t<1999}=1 \mid \mathbf{X}_{i,t\le1998}) \text{, estimated via:} \\
10\text{-fold cross-validation:} &\\
&\text{Reported Leak}_{i,s,t} = g(\text{Wall}_i, \text{Age}_{it}, \mathbf{X}_{it}, \alpha_t, \delta_s) + \epsilon_{i,s,t}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-risk-score}


where $\mathbf{X}_{i,\,t \le 1998}$ is a vector of pre-policy facility characteristics, including tank age, capacity, construction material, soil type, and past leak counts. This score, $\hat\theta_i^{\text{pre}}$, provides an ex-ante measure of each facility's underlying risk, untainted by any post-1999 behavioral changes.


#### Step 2: Testing for Adverse Selection

With the baseline risk score in hand, the first empirical test is for adverse selection. The key question is whether facilities that chose to purchase private insurance after 1999 were already riskier *before* the policy change. I conduct two complementary tests for this.

The first is a direct application of the classic positive-correlation test from @chiappori2000testing, which compares the raw, pre-policy claim rates between facilities that would later choose private insurance versus self-insurance. Let $D_i \in \{0,1\}$ be an indicator for the facility's choice of private insurance ($D_i=1$) in the post-policy period. The test compares the mean pre-policy claim rates between the two groups. While intuitive, this test may have limited statistical power. Since leaks are rare events, a facility's pre-policy claim history is a noisy measure of its true underlying risk; many high-risk facilities may have had zero leaks simply by chance.

To address the low power of the direct claims test, I conduct a second, more powerful test using the estimated risk score, $\hat\theta_i^{\text{pre}}$. This score provides a more stable measure by summarizing a facility's systematic risk based on its fundamental characteristics (age, construction, etc.), smoothing out the random noise inherent in realized leak data. The test is a comparison of the mean baseline risk score across the two groups:
$$
\Delta_{\text{SEL}} = E[\hat\theta_i^{\mathrm{pre}} \mid D_i=1] - E[\hat\theta_i^{\mathrm{pre}} \mid D_i=0]
$${#eq-selection-test}

A statistically significant, positive value for $\Delta_{\text{SEL}}$ provides stronger evidence of adverse selection, indicating that facilities that appear systematically riskier based on their ex-ante characteristics are the ones that selected into the private insurance pool.

#### Step 3: Testing for Moral Hazard or Detection Effects

The second test examines whether having insurance coverage changes a facility's behavior, conditional on its baseline risk. To isolate this effect from selection, I stratify the sample into deciles based on the ex-ante risk score, $\hat\theta_i^{\mathrm{pre}}$. Within each narrow risk stratum, facilities are, on average, observationally equivalent in their baseline risk, allowing for a clean comparison of post-policy outcomes.

For each risk decile $d$, I test the null hypothesis that the average *reported* leak rate is the same for privately insured and self-insured facilities:
$$
H_{0,d}: E[\text{Reported Leak}_{i, t > 1999} \mid \hat\theta_i^{\mathrm{pre}} \in d, D_i=1] = E[\text{Reported Leak}_{i, t > 1999} \mid \hat\theta_i^{\mathrm{pre}} \in d, D_i=0]
$${#eq-moral-hazard-test}

Rejection of this null hypothesis implies that insurance coverage has a causal effect on the propensity to report a leak. However, this observed effect is ambiguous and could arise from two distinct, non-mutually exclusive channels:

1.  **True Moral Hazard:** Insured owners, shielded from the full financial consequences of a leak, may reduce their investment in costly maintenance and safety precautions. This would increase the *actual frequency* of leaks.
2.  **Detection or Reporting Effects:** Insurance contracts may require more stringent monitoring or inspections, increasing the probability that an existing leak is *detected*. Alternatively, insured owners may be more willing to *report* a detected leak, knowing that the cleanup costs are covered.

Both channels lead to the same observable outcome: a higher reported claim rate for insured facilities. Because the data only contain information on *reported* leaks, not the underlying true leak frequency or unobserved maintenance efforts, this test cannot separately identify moral hazard from detection and reporting effects. It can only measure their combined impact. Nonetheless, by conditioning on ex-ante risk, this test successfully disentangles these combined behavioral effects from the selection channel.

#### Step 4: Doubly-Robust Estimation of Causal Effects

Finally, to estimate the average treatment effect of private insurance, I employ a doubly-robust difference-in-differences estimator. This approach combines propensity score weighting with an outcome regression model to provide an estimate that is consistent if either the propensity score model or the outcome model is correctly specified.

First, within the sample matched on risk-score deciles, I estimate a propensity score, $\hat{\pi}_i$, which is the predicted probability that facility $i$ selects into private insurance, based on its pre-policy characteristics:
$$
\hat\pi_i = \hat P(D_i=1 \mid \mathbf{X}_{i,\,t \le 1998})
$$

These propensity scores are used to compute stabilized inverse-probability weights ($w_i$) to balance the treatment and control groups.

Second, I estimate the following weighted difference-in-differences model with facility and year fixed effects:
$$
\text{Y}_{it} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \beta(D_i \times \text{Post}_t) + f(\hat\theta_i^{\text{pre}}) + \varepsilon_{it}
$${#eq-did-robust}

This equation is estimated using the weights $w_i$. The coefficient of interest, $\beta$, captures the causal effect of private insurance on reported leak rates and firm behavior, having controlled for both observable pre-policy characteristics (via weighting) and unobservable time-invariant heterogeneity (via facility fixed effects), as well as flexibly controlling for baseline risk in the outcome model ($f(\hat\theta_i^{\text{pre}})$).

#### Assumptions and Diagnostics

This empirical strategy relies on several key assumptions:


1.  **Monotonicity:** The estimated risk score $\hat\theta_i^{\text{pre}}$ is a monotonic function of the true underlying risk.
2.  **Exogeneity:** The risk score and propensity score are estimated using only pre-policy data, ensuring they are not influenced by the treatment itself.
3.  **Proportionality:** As claim cost data is unavailable, I assume that claim *frequency* is a reasonable proxy for claim *severity*. This is a strong assumption, but necessary for adapting the selection market framework.

To validate the approach, I will conduct a series of diagnostic tests, including plotting the overlap of propensity scores, running placebo regressions using pre-policy outcomes, and examining the relationship between risk scores and claim rates graphically across different coverage types.

## The Causal Impact of Risk-Based Insurance on Firm Behavior

This section presents the main empirical results of the paper, using a difference-in-differences framework to compare Texas with control states that maintained public insurance funds. The analysis proceeds in two steps. First, to establish the economic rationale for risk-based pricing, I demonstrate that observable facility characteristics, such as tank age and construction type, are strong and significant predictors of environmental risk. This confirms that a key condition for an efficient insurance market is met. Second, having established this predictive relationship, I then estimate the causal impact of the transition to risk-based insurance on the behavior of incumbent UST facilities, focusing on their decisions to close, replace, or exit the market. Finally, I examine whether these behavioral changes had a measurable impact on environmental outcomes, specifically reported leak rates. This two-step approach allows for a robust analysis of the effects of risk-based insurance on both firm behavior and environmental risk mitigation.

### Environmental Risk and UST Facility Characteristics

Risk-rated insurance markets can significantly reduce environmental hazards by aligning private facility incentives with social costs—a critical mechanism for internalizing pollution externalities. When insurance premiums accurately reflect facility-specific risk factors, owners face direct financial incentives to invest in safer technologies and operational practices. However, the effectiveness of this market-based approach hinges entirely on insurers' ability to accurately assess facility-level risk characteristics. Without precise risk assessment, the transition from flat-fee to cost-based pricing contracts may fail to improve environmental outcomes or could even create perverse incentives for underreporting and maintenance avoidance. To quantify the predictive relationship between observable facility characteristics and actual environmental risk, I employ a 10-fold cross-validation approach using a comprehensive facility-level panel dataset of USTs:



$$
\begin{aligned}
10\text{-fold cross-validation:} &\\
\text{Reported Leak}_{i,s,t} =& \alpha_t + \delta_s + \sum_{k} \beta_k \text{Wall}_{k,i} + \sum_{m} \gamma_m \text{Age Bins}_{m,i} + \\
&\sum_{k,m} \zeta_{km} (\text{Wall}_{k,i} \times \text{Age}_{m,i}) + \theta\mathbf{X}_{i,s,t} + \epsilon_{i,s,t}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-risk-pred}


In this cross-validation framework, I model the probability of a reported leak as a function of facility characteristics while controlling for temporal and spatial heterogeneity. The dependent variable, $\text{Reported Leak}_{i,s,t}$, is a binary indicator equal to one if facility $i$ in state $s$ reports a leak in year $t$. The model includes year fixed effects ($\alpha_t$) and state fixed effects ($\delta_s$) to account for temporal trends and state-specific regulatory environments, respectively. To capture the relationship between tank technology and leak risk, I include indicator variables for single-walled UST systems ($\text{Wall}_{k,i}$) and categorize facility age into 5-year bins ($\text{AgeBin}_{m,i}$). The interaction terms between wall type and age bins ($\text{Wall}_{k,i} \times \text{Age}_{m,i}$) allow for heterogeneous effects of tank construction across different facility age profiles. Additionally, the vector $\mathbf{X}_{i,s,t}$ contains other facility-specific characteristics that may influence leak probability, including tank size, construction material, and the employed release detection method. This specification enables the assessment of how observable facility characteristics predict environmental risk while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across time and space.



@fig-leak-risk plots the predicted annual probability of a reported leak by tank age and construction type, confirming that these observable characteristics are strong predictors of environmental risk and thus provide a clear economic rationale for risk-based pricing. The two technologies exhibit starkly different hazard profiles. Single-wall tanks (the orange line) follow an inverted U-shape, with the probability of a reported leak rising sharply to a peak of nearly 1.8% for tanks aged 20-25 years before declining as the riskiest units are presumably removed from service. In contrast, double-wall tanks (the green line) have a much lower and flatter risk profile for most of their operational life. The key takeaway is that single-wall tanks are substantially more likely to have a reported leak than their double-wall counterparts throughout the critical 5-to-30-year age window. This fundamental, predictable difference in risk based on observable technology and age is undeniable.

\small _Note:_    This figure shows predicted annual leak probabilities by tank age and wall type, estimated using 10-fold cross-validation with facility-level sampling. The model specification includes wall type interacted with age bin categories, controlling for active tanks, fuel type (gasoline/diesel), year, and state fixed effects. Predictions are generated exclusively from out-of-sample facilities in each iteration to reduce overfitting. Model performance metrics: Overall RMSE = 0.0963, Single-Walled RMSE = 0.1063, Double-Walled RMSE = 0.081. The total sample includes 4,191,898 facility-year observations with an overall leak rate of 1.13%. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for the mean prediction across all cross-validation iterations. Single-walled tanks consistently show higher leak risk compared to double-walled tanks, with the risk gap widening as tanks age, particularly after 15 years of operation.

## Causal Evidence of Risk-Adjusted Insurance on UST Facility Behavior

This section presents the empirical evidence of the effect of the transition to private market insurance on UST facility behavior. To ensure clean identification of the causal impact, I restrict the analysis to single-walled tanks installed before 1999. This sample restriction serves multiple analytical purposes. First, single-walled tanks represent the highest observable risk category, making them particularly sensitive to insurance design changes and thus providing the strongest signal for detection. Second, focusing exclusively on pre-1999 installations eliminates potential selection effects from facilities that entered after the policy announcement, which might confound the treatment effect. Finally, this approach allows me to isolate how incumbent facilities—those directly experiencing the regulatory regime shift—modified their behavior in response to the transition from flat-fee to risk-adjusted insurance premiums. By examining this well-defined cohort, I can more precisely estimate the treatment effect while minimizing bias from compositional changes in the market.


To study the UST owner response I estimate a panel differnece in differences model and the following event-study specifications to identify the causal effect of the transition to private market insurance on UST facility behavior:

$$
\text{Tank Closure}_{i,t} = \beta \cdot \text{Treatment}_{i,t} + \sum_{a=1}^{N} \gamma_a \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{AgeBin}_a]_{i,t} + \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \epsilon_{i,t}
$${#eq-tank-closure-did}

$$
\text{Tank Closure}_{i,t} = \sum_{k=-K, k \neq -1}^{L} \beta_k \cdot \mathbf{1}[t - t^*_i = k] \cdot \text{Texas}_i + \sum_{a=1}^{N} \gamma_a \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{AgeBin}_a]_{i,t} + \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \epsilon_{i,t}
$${#eq-tank-closure-event}

I estimate two empirical specifications to identify the causal effect of transitioning to private market insurance on incumbent Texas UST Owners. Equation \ref{eq-tank-closure-did} presents a standard difference-in-differences specification where $\text{Treatment}_{i,t}$ is an indicator equal to one for Texas facilities in the post-1999 period. The coefficient $\beta$ captures the average treatment effect of the policy change. The specification includes facility fixed effects ($\alpha_i$) that account for time-invariant facility characteristics and year fixed effects ($\alpha_t$) that control for common temporal shocks. I also include a flexible set of age indicators ($\mathbf{1}[\text{AgeBin}_a]_{i,t}$) to account for differential closure rates across the facility lifecycle.

Equation \ref{eq-tank-closure-event} presents an event study specification that allows for time-varying treatment effects. The coefficients $\beta_k$ trace out the dynamic response to the policy change, where $k$ indexes time relative to the treatment year $t^*_i$. The omitted category is $k=-1$ (the year immediately before treatment), making all coefficients relative to this pre-treatment period. This specification maintains the same controls as the difference-in-differences model, allowing me to examine pre-trends for parallel trends assumption validation and to investigate how the treatment effect evolves over time.

:::

The results in @tbl-reg_closure provide strong evidence that the transition to risk-based insurance induced a significant behavioral response from the owners of high-risk facilities. The positive and highly significant coefficients in columns (1) and (2) show that the policy increased the annual probability of closing a single-walled tank in Texas by 1.8 to 3.0 percentage points relative to control states. However, the subsequent columns reveal a crucial nuance in this response. The negative and significant coefficients in columns (3) and (4) indicate that, conditional on a closure, Texas facilities were 9.5 to 11.1 percentage points less likely to exit the market entirely. Correspondingly, column (6) shows they were 10.3 percentage points more likely to replace the tank. Taken together, these findings suggest that risk-adjusted insurance did not simply drive high-risk firms out of the market. Instead, it created a powerful incentive for technology adoption, encouraging incumbent owners to scrap their riskiest assets (single-walled tanks) and invest in safer replacements, thereby reducing environmental risk while continuing operations.

\small _Note:_    TThis figure presents an event study of the differential effect of Texas' 1999 transition from public to private insurance on underground storage tank (UST) closure decisions. The plot shows point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the interaction between a Texas indicator and each event year, relative to 1998 (the year before the policy change). The sample is restricted to facilities that had only single-walled tanks in the pre-1999 period. The underlying regression includes facility and year fixed effects, with standard errors clustered at the state level. The specification controls for a 1998 spike in tank removals that occurred industry-wide. The pattern reveals how the policy affected the timing and magnitude of tank closure decisions, with particular attention to whether facility owners strategically accelerated or delayed tank closures in response to the policy change. Estimates to the right of the vertical red line represent post-policy treatment effects, while estimates to the left establish the pre-trends necessary for causal identification in the difference-in-differences framework.

Dynamic Policy Effects on Tank Closures (Single-Wall Tanks, Texas)

:::

The event study in @fig-close-event complements the regression results by visualizing the dynamic impact of the policy on single-walled tank closures and testing the crucial parallel trends assumption. The coefficients for the pre-treatment period (years prior to 1999) are all statistically insignificant and centered around zero. This provides strong visual support for the parallel trends assumption, indicating no systematic differences in closure trends between Texas and control states before the policy change. Following the transition to private insurance in 1999 (year 0), there is an immediate and sustained increase in the probability of tank closure in Texas relative to control states. Furthermore, the magnitude of the treatment effect grows over time, with the point estimates trending upward throughout the post-policy period. This suggests that the incentive to remove high-risk, single-walled tanks was not a temporary shock but a persistent and strengthening behavioral response to risk-based pricing. Together, these dynamic results reinforce the causal interpretation of the findings in @tbl-reg_closure, demonstrating that the introduction of risk-adjusted insurance led to an immediate and growing increase in the removal of the riskiest assets from the market.




## Effect of Risk-Based Pricing on Reported Leaks
The preceding analysis demonstrates that risk-based insurance pricing induced a significant behavioral response, accelerating the closure and replacement of high-risk, single-walled tanks. The final and most critical question is whether this behavioral change translated into a tangible reduction in environmental harm. To assess this, I examine the policy's impact on the frequency of reported leaks, the primary measure of environmental incidents in this context.

The transition to risk-based pricing is expected to reduce leak incidents through two primary channels, both of which were identified in the previous section:

The Replacement Effect: By incentivizing the replacement of old, single-walled tanks with newer, safer technology, the policy should mechanically lower the aggregate leak rate over time.
The Exit Effect: The policy may also induce the permanent exit of the highest-risk or least profitable facilities, further reducing the stock of leak-prone tanks.
To estimate the combined impact of these channels, I employ a difference-in-differences specification analogous to the one used for closure decisions. The model is estimated on the same sample of single-walled tanks operating before 1999 to isolate the policy's effect on the incumbent, high-risk cohort:

$$ 
\text{Reported Leak}_{i,t} = \beta \cdot \text{Texas}_{i} \times \text{Post1999}_{t} + \sum_{a=1}^{N} \gamma_a \cdot \mathbf{1}[\text{AgeBin}_a]_{i,t} + \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \epsilon_{i,t} 
$$ 


Here, the dependent variable, $\text{Reported Leak}_{i,t}$, is a binary indicator equal to one if facility $i$ reported a leak in year $t$. The coefficient of interest, $\beta$, captures the average change in the probability of a reported leak for Texas facilities after the policy transition, relative to control states. The model includes a full set of facility ($\alpha_i$) and year ($\alpha_t$) fixed effects to control for time-invariant facility characteristics and common time shocks, respectively. It also includes flexible controls for tank age ($\mathbf{1}[\text{AgeBin}a]{i,t}$) to account for the natural lifecycle of leak risk. A negative and significant estimate for $\beta$ would provide strong evidence that risk-based insurance pricing was successful in reducing environmental damages.

**Policy effects on single-walled facility reported leak rates**.  

:::

The results in @tbl-leak_results  show that the transition to risk-based insurance pricing had a statistically significant and negative impact on the probability of reported leaks among single-walled tanks. The coefficient estimates of -0.0097 in column (1) and -0.0124 in column (2) indicate that the policy reduced the annual probability of a reported leak by approximately 0.97% to 1.24% relative to control states. This reduction is economically meaningful, especially given the baseline leak rate of around 1.13% for single-walled tanks in the pre-policy period. The inclusion of age bin controls in column (2) does not materially change the magnitude or significance of the treatment effect, suggesting that the policy's impact is robust to accounting for differential leak rates across tank ages.


#  Dynamic Discrete Choice Model

In this section, I develop a dynamic structural model of the facility owner's decision problem. The framework follows the optimal stopping literature where agents weigh the immediate returns of operation against the liability risks of aging capital @rust_optimal_1987.

## 3.1 The Agent's Problem

I model the behavior of a risk-neutral facility owner operating a single underground storage tank in an infinite horizon setting. Time is discrete and indexed by $t=1, 2, \dots, \infty$. In each period, the agent observes the state of the facility, $x_t$, and a vector of idiosyncratic payoff shocks, $\varepsilon_t$. Conditional on these states, the agent chooses a binary action $d_t \in \{Maintain, Close\}$ to maximize the expected present discounted value of future payoffs. The discount factor is denoted by $\beta \in (0, 1)$.

## State Space and Transitions

The observable state vector $x_t = (A_t, w_t, \rho_t)$ characterizes the facility's physical and regulatory environment. The variable $A_t \in \{1, \dots, 9\}$ represents the age of the tank, discretized into five-year bins, where $A=9$ is an absorbing state for tanks older than 40 years. The variable $w_t \in \{Single, Double\}$ denotes the tank's wall type, which is fixed over time. Finally, $\rho_t \in \{FF, RB\}$ indicates the insurance regime, where $FF$ represents the flat-fee public fund and $RB$ represents the risk-based private market.

The state transition process is governed by the facility's choice. If the agent chooses to close the facility ($d_t = Close$), the process terminates. If the agent chooses to maintain the facility ($d_t = Maintain$), the tank ages stochastically. I define the transition probability $F(x_{t+1} | x_t, d_t)$ such that wall type and regime are persistent, while age follows a stochastic process:

$$
A_{t+1} = \begin{cases} 
A_t + 1 & \text{with probability } \pi_{up}(A_t) \\
A_t & \text{with probability } 1 - \pi_{up}(A_t)
\end{cases}
$$

This stochastic aging process captures the uncertainty in asset depreciation and allows the model to match the empirical duration of tank active life.

## Flow Payoffs

The period payoff depends on the chosen action and the structural parameters governing revenue, costs, and risk preferences. Payoffs are normalized such that the net revenue from operation is the numeraire.

If the agent chooses to **Maintain**, the flow utility is specified as:

$$
u(x_t, Maintain) = 1 + \gamma_{price} \cdot P(x_t) - \gamma_{risk} \cdot h(x_t) \cdot L(x_t)
$$

The first term, $1$, represents the normalized annual net revenue. The second term captures the disutility of insurance premiums, where $P(x_t)$ is the observed premium and $\gamma_{price}$ is the price sensitivity parameter. The third term represents the internalized cost of environmental risk, where $h(x_t)$ is the engineering hazard rate of a leak, $L(x_t)$ is the expected remediation cost, and $\gamma_{risk}$ is a scaling parameter. A value of $\gamma_{risk} < 1$ would imply moral hazard, where firms undervalue the true expected liability.

If the agent chooses to **Close**, the facility exits the market and the agent receives a terminal scrap value:

$$
u(x_t, Close) = \kappa
$$

The parameter $\kappa$ captures the liquidation value of the land and equipment, net of any decommissioning costs. This value is assumed to be constant across states.

## The Value Function

The agent's optimization problem can be represented by the Bellman equation. Assuming the idiosyncratic shocks $\varepsilon_t$ follow a Type I Extreme Value distribution with scale parameter $\sigma$, the ex-ante value function $V(x_t)$ is given by:

$$
V(x_t) = \int \max_{d \in \{M, C\}} \left\{ v(x_t, d) + \varepsilon_t(d) \right\} dG(\varepsilon)
$$

where $v(x_t, d)$ represents the conditional choice-specific value function:

$$
v(x_t, d) = u(x_t, d) + \beta \sum_{x_{t+1}} V(x_{t+1}) F(x_{t+1} | x_t, d)
$$

This structure allows for the estimation of the structural parameters $\theta = (\kappa, \gamma_{price}, \gamma_{risk})$ using a Nested Pseudo-Likelihood (NPL) estimator (Aguirregabiria & Mira, 2007).

## Identification

The identification of the structural parameters $\theta = (\kappa, \gamma_{price}, \gamma_{risk})$ relies on mapping distinct sources of data variation to specific model primitives. While the parameters are estimated jointly via the Nested Pseudo-Likelihood algorithm, we can heuristically characterize the variation that identifies each term.

The scrap value, $\kappa$, is identified by the unconditional probability of facility exit. In the optimal stopping framework, $\kappa$ acts as the reservation value; therefore, a higher average exit rate across all states implies a higher relative scrap value, holding flow profits constant. Identification requires that the baseline exit rate is not driven solely by unobserved heterogeneity, which we address through the inclusion of facility-level fixed effects in the reduced-form steps.

The price sensitivity parameter, $\gamma_{price}$, is identified by the response of exit rates to cross-sectional variation in insurance premiums. The transition from the flat-fee Public Fund (FF) to the risk-based private market (RB) generates exogenous variation in $P(x_t)$ that is independent of the facility's engineering risk. Specifically, under the FF regime, premiums are constant ($\frac{\partial P}{\partial A} = 0$), whereas under the RB regime, premiums rise with age ($\frac{\partial P}{\partial A} > 0$). The covariance between these policy-induced price shocks and subsequent closure decisions isolates the agent's marginal disutility of payment.

The risk internalization parameter, $\gamma_{risk}$, is identified by the gradient of exit rates with respect to the leak hazard $h(x_t)$, distinct from the premium channel. While premiums in the private market are correlated with risk, the correlation is not perfect due to deductible structures and coverage limits. If firms face liability costs beyond the premium (e.g., deductibles or reputational harm), they will exit high-risk states at a rate faster than predicted by premium costs alone. This residual sensitivity of the exit rule to the engineering hazard rate $h(A_t)$ identifies $\gamma_{risk}$.


# Discussion

The empirical results present a clear and compelling narrative about the power of market-based environmental policy. The transition to risk-adjusted insurance premiums in Texas prompted a significant and rational response from the owners of the highest-risk USTs. Faced with insurance costs that reflected the true environmental hazard of their aging, single-walled tanks, owners accelerated their closure. Critically, this did not lead to a mass exodus from the market. Instead, the policy spurred investment in safer technology, as facilities were more likely to replace their risky tanks rather than shut down entirely. This finding directly addresses a common concern that stringent environmental pricing will simply drive firms out of business, demonstrating instead that it can be a powerful catalyst for technology adoption.

This behavioral shift from retaining old, risky assets to investing in new, safer ones translated directly into improved environmental outcomes. The nearly one-percentage-point reduction in the annual leak rate for this high-risk cohort is not only statistically significant but also economically meaningful, representing a near-elimination of the pre-policy baseline risk. This provides strong causal evidence that aligning private insurance costs with public environmental risk can effectively internalize externalities. The success of the Texas model offers a clear lesson for the many states still relying on flat-fee public funds, which mute price signals and subsidize the continued operation of the riskiest facilities.

The findings underscore that when risk is observable and can be priced, insurance markets can function as a powerful regulatory tool. The stark difference in leak probabilities between single- and double-walled tanks, which grows with age, provided a clear margin for insurers to price on. By doing so, the private market created a persistent financial incentive for risk mitigation that achieved tangible environmental benefits, validating decades of economic theory on liability and insurance design.

# Conclusion

This paper provides the first facility-level causal evidence on the impact of transitioning from a flat-fee public UST insurance fund to a risk-rated private market. Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages Texas's 1999 policy shift, the analysis demonstrates that forcing firms to bear the expected cost of their environmental risk profile has profound effects. The introduction of risk-based pricing led to an immediate and sustained increase in the closure of high-risk, single-walled tanks. This response was characterized not by market exit, but by technology upgrading, as firms chose to replace their obsolete tanks with safer alternatives. Ultimately, this behavioral change resulted in a substantial and significant reduction in reported environmental leaks.

The success of this price-based mechanism in reducing environmental risk invites a crucial policy comparison. While this study highlights the effectiveness of aligning market incentives with social costs, an important avenue for future work is to contrast this approach with traditional command-and-control regulations. For instance, comparing the effects of risk-based pricing with the impact of vintage-differentiated regulations (VDRs) or direct technology mandates could illuminate the relative cost-effectiveness and efficiency of these different policy instruments @shavell_chapter_2007. Such analysis would provide regulators with a more complete understanding of the optimal policy mix for managing the significant environmental hazards posed by aging infrastructure in the U.S. and beyond.

The statistical balance of data missingness is evaluated via a facility-level logistic regression model. Let $M_i$ denote a binary indicator equal to 1 if facility $i$ is excluded due to a missing tank installation or closure date, and 0 otherwise. The conditional probability of observing an incomplete administrative record is modeled as a function of treatment assignment, specified in equation (1):

$$
 \Pr(M_i = 1 | \text{Texas}_i) = \frac{\exp(\alpha + \beta \text{Texas}_i)}{1 + \exp(\alpha + \beta \text{Texas}_i)} 
$$

where $\text{Texas}_i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if facility $i$ is located in the treatment state, and 0 if located in a control state. The coefficient of interest, $\beta$, captures the log-odds of data attrition for treated facilities relative to controls. The maximum likelihood estimation yields a statistically insignificant coefficient on the treatment indicator ($p = 0.5361$). This result confirms the null hypothesis that $ \beta = 0 $, establishing that the probability of exclusion is orthogonal to the regulatory mandate and satisfying the requisite identifying assumption for the primary difference-in-differences estimator.
