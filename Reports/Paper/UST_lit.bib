A censored bivariate probit model is estimated using data from Louisiana on inspection, compliance, releases and other socioeconomic and biophysical characteristics of {UST} localities to examine the relationship between increased inspection frequency and compliance. We find that increased inspection frequency improved compliance with {UST} requirements in Louisiana and this impact is heterogeneous based on a facility’s compliance status at the last inspection—larger impact for those facilities that were compliant than those that were noncompliant at the last inspection.},

Among small ﬁrms, the policy substantially improved environmental outcomes and reduced production. Most production was re-allocated to larger ﬁrms with better environmental records, but highcost production where social cost may have exceeded social beneﬁt decreased. These results suggest that incomplete internalization of environmental costs due to bankruptcy is an important determinant of industry structure and safety eﬀort in hazardous industries.},

The analyses suggest that both the economies of scale and the liquidity constraints arguments can explain the uneven impact {UST} regulations had on different petroleum retail outlets. Economies of scale give large outlets a greater competitive advantage because it is more difficult for small outlets to pass on compliance costs to customers. Liquidity constraints make outlets owned by small firms more vulnerable to {UST} regulations because small firms do not have the financial capability to replace or upgrade equipment as required by {UST} technical standards. This suggests that small businesses have more difficulties competing with large businesses under environmental regulations.},

We analyze unique data from a large auto sales company serving the subprime market. Short-term liquidity appears to be a key driver of consumer behavior. Demand increases sharply during tax rebate season and purchases are highly sensitive to down-payment requirements. Lenders also face substantial informational problems. Default rates rise significantly with loan size, providing a rationale for loan caps, and higher-risk borrowers demand larger loans. This adverse selection is mitigated, however, by risk-based pricing. ({JEL} D14, D82, D83, G21)},

To do this, we develop an empirical model of the demand for ﬁnanced purchases that incorporates both adverse selection and repayment incentives.

We show how different elements of loan contracts affect the quality of the borrower pool and subsequent loan performance. We also evaluate the returns to credit scoring that allows sellers to customize ﬁnancing terms to individual applicants.

We show that these had effects of similar magnitude.

We show that the relationship between an agent’s type, the quantity he trades, and the price he pays is jointly determined by the severity of adverse selection and the concentration of market power. Therefore, quantifying the effects of adverse selection requires controlling for market structure. We also show that increasing competition and reducing informational asymmetries can decrease welfare.},

	abstract = {Workers’ compensation insurance, which provides no-fault coverage for work-related injuries, is mandatory in nearly all states. We use administrative data from a unique market without a coverage mandate to estimate the demand for workers’ compensation insurance, leveraging regulatory premium updates for identification. We find that a 1 percent increase in premiums leads to approximately a 0.3 percent decline in coverage. Drawing upon these estimates and data on costs, we examine potential justifications for government intervention to increase coverage. This analysis suggests that several forms of market failure—such as adverse selection, market power, and externalities—may not justify a mandate in this setting. ({JEL} G22, G52, J28, K13, K31)},

We introduce a methodological framework that takes into account the unobserved site-heterogeneity and simultaneously models duration in the different states. The results show that although site-heterogeneity contributes to make remediation a slow process, the third state, from the elaborate risk classification to the cleanup start, is a particular bottleneck. Even if government funding can speed up the process at this state, the effect is minuscule compared to the amounts of funding required. Thus, there is a need for policy to also focus on other barriers to remediation.},

We argue that the duration of cleanup, conditional on a large number of site characteristics, should be independent of the race and income profile of the neighborhood in which the site is located. Since the demographic composition of a neighborhood changes during the cleanup process, we explore whether cleanup durations are related to neighborhood demographics recorded at the time when the cleanup is initiated. We estimate a semiparametric Bayesian Proportional Hazard model, which also allows for unobserved site specific heterogeneity, and find that sites located in black, urban and lower educated neighborhoods were discriminated against at the beginning of the program but that the degree of bias diminished over time. Executive Order 12898 of 1994 appears to have re-prioritized resources for the faster cleanup of sites located in less wealthy neighborhoods. We do not find that the litigation process is an impediment in the cleanup process, and support the notion that community involvement plays an important role.},

The paper presents a conceptual framework that identiﬁes the key forces determining the value of offering choice, reviews some existing evidence on these forces, and aims to guide further empirical research in different insurance domains. The value of offering choice is higher the larger the variation in individual valuations, but gets reduced by both selection on risk and selection on moral hazard. The implementation of choice-based policies is further challenged by the presence of adverse selection and choice frictions or the obligation to offer basic uncompensated care. These inefﬁciencies can be seen as externalities, which do not rationalize the absence of providing choice per se, but point to the need for regulatory policies and the potential value of corrective pricing à la Pigou.},

The approach retains the transparency of using reduced-form willingness to pay and cost curves, but it adds one additional sufﬁcient statistic: the percentage difference in marginal utilities between insured and uninsured. I provide an approach to estimate this additional statistic that uses only the reduced-form willingness to pay curve, combined with a measure of risk aversion. I compare the approach to structural approaches that require fully specifying the choice environment and information sets of individuals. I apply the approach using existing willingness to pay and cost curve estimates from the low-income health insurance exchange in Massachusetts. Ex ante optimal insurance prices are roughly 30\% lower than prices that maximize observed market surplus. While mandates reduce market surplus, the results suggest they would actually increase ex ante expected utility.},

            The world has 1.4 billion passenger vehicles. How should governments regulate their air pollution emissions? A Pigouvian tax is technologically infeasible. Most countries instead rely on exhaust standards that limit air pollution emissions per mile for new vehicles. We assess the effectiveness and efficiency of these standards, which are the centerpiece of U.S. Clean Air Act regulation of transportation, and counterfactual policies. We show that the air pollution emissions per mile of new U.S. vehicles has fallen spectacularly, by over 99\%, since standards began in 1967. Several research designs with a half century of data suggest that exhaust standards have caused most of this decline. Yet exhaust standards are not cost-effective in part because they fail to encourage scrap of older vehicles, which account for the majority of emissions. To study counterfactual policies, we develop an analytical and a quantitative model of the vehicle fleet. Analysis of these models suggests that tighter exhaust standards increase social welfare and increasing registration fees on dirty vehicles yields even larger gains by accelerating scrap, although both reforms have complex effects on inequality.},

We develop a methodology for econometric assessment of such costs, and apply it to the automobile air pollution standards of 1972-1981. We find that these costs are important. For the first standards implemented in the 1970s, they exceeded the costs of pollution control equipment installed on the car and the costs of decreased fuel efficiency. Since then, however, advances in compliance technology have allowed increases in automobile quality so that incremental costs of recent standards are much lower than previously believed.},

Using data from fossil fuel fired boilers at electric power plants, I estimate the structural parameters of the model and assess the impact of grandfathering in the Clean Air Act on sulfur dioxide emissions. Counterfactual policy simulations show that an increase in the stringency of performance standards would have led to a decrease in investment in new boilers. However, this does not lead to increased emissions, since there is less investment in dirtier coal boilers as compared to relatively cleaner oil or natural gas boilers.},

	abstract = {This paper formulates a simple regenerative optimal stopping model of bus engine replacement to describe the behavior of Harold Zurcher, superintendent of maintenance at the Madison (Wisconsin) Metropolitan Bus Company. The null hypothesis is that Zurcher's decisions on bus engine replacement coincide with an optimal stopping rule: a strategy which specifies whether or not to replace the current bus engine each period as a function of observed and unobserved state variables. The optimal stopping rule is the solution to a stochastic dynamic programming problem that formalizes the trade-off between the conflicting objectives of minimizing maintenance costs versus minimizing unexpected engine failures. The model depends on unknown "primitive parameters" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a "bottom-up" approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a "nested fixed point" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.},

This model is consistent with the individual firm data. The second model is the familiar distributed lag model which predicts that investment will take place smoothly. This model is inconsistent with the individual firm data. In addition, predictions of the aggregate investment of the 15 firms are made with the lumpy model and these fit about as well as a distributed lag model estimated with the aggregate data.

We show that these transformations separate the zeros from the positives such that the estimated parameters are related to those from a scaled linear probability model. The retransformed marginal effects and elasticities are sensitive to changes in a shape parameter, ranging in magnitude between those of an untransformed least squares regression and those of a scaled linear probability model. Instead of transforming the dependent variable with non-negative outcomes that includes zeros, we recommend using a non-transformed dependent variable, such as a two-part model, untransformed linear regression, or Poisson.},

	abstract = {High pollution persists in many developing countries despite strict environmental rules. We use a field experiment and a structural model to study how plant emission standards are enforced. In collaboration with an Indian environmental regulator, we experimentally doubled the rate of inspection for treatment plants and required that the extra inspections be assigned randomly. We find that treatment plants only slightly increased compliance. We hypothesize that this weak effect is due to poor targeting, since the random inspections in the treatment found fewer extreme violators than the regulator's own discretionary inspections. To unbundle the roles of extra inspections and the removal of discretion over what plants to target, we set out a model of environmental regulation where the regulator targets inspections, based on a signal of pollution, to maximize plant abatement. Using the experiment to identify key parameters of the model, we find that the regulator aggressively targets its discretionary inspections, to the degree that half of the plants receive fewer than one inspection per year, while plants expected to be the dirtiest may receive ten. Counterfactual simulations show that discretion in targeting helps enforcement: inspections that the regulator assigns cause three times more abatement than would the same number of randomly assigned inspections. Nonetheless, we find that the regulator's information on plant pollution is poor, and improvements in monitoring would reduce emissions.},

This paper investigates the key determinants of this increase in electriﬁcation using data on heating choices from millions of U.S. households over a 70-year period. Energy prices, geography, climate, housing characteristics, and household income are shown to collectively explain 90\% of the increase, with changing energy prices by far the most important single factor. This framework is then used to calculate the economic cost of an electriﬁcation mandate for new homes. Households in warm states tend to prefer electricity anyway, so would be made worse o↵ by less than \$350 annually on average. Households in cold states, however, tend to strongly prefer natural gas so would be made worse o↵ by more than \$1000 annually. These ﬁndings are directly relevant to a growing number of policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions through electriﬁcation.},

Evidence is particularly lacking from low- and middle-income countries, despite a widespread view that these countries have many of the best opportunities. This paper evaluates a ﬁeld trial in Mexico in which a quasi-experimental sample of new homes was provided with insulation and other energy-eﬃcient upgrades. A novel feature of our study is that we deploy large numbers of data loggers which allow us to measure temperature and humidity at high frequency inside homes. We ﬁnd that the upgrades had no detectable impact on electricity use or thermal comfort, with essentially identical temperature and humidity levels in upgraded and non-upgraded homes. These results stand in sharp contrast to the engineering estimates that predicted considerable improvements in thermal comfort and up to a 26\% decrease in electricity use. As we document, part of the explanation is that most households have their windows open on hot days, nullifying the thermal beneﬁts of roof and wall insulation. Overall, we conclude that the beneﬁts from these investments are unlikely to exceed the costs, which added \$650-\$850 {USD} to the cost of each home. Our results underscore the urgent need to fully incorporate human behavior into engineering models of energy use.},

California enacted the first such codes in 1978 and has tightened them every few years since. I evaluate the resulting energy savings three ways: comparing energy used by houses constructed under different standards, controlling for building and occupant characteristics; examining how energy use varies with outdoor temperatures; and comparing energy used by houses of different vintages in California to that same difference in other states. All three approaches yield estimated energy savings significantly short of those projected when the regulations were enacted. ({JEL} Q48, Q51, Q52)},

Evidence is particularly lacking from low- and middle-income countries, despite a widespread view that these countries have many of the best opportunities. This paper evaluates a ﬁeld trial in Mexico in which a quasi-experimental sample of new homes was provided with insulation and other energy-eﬃcient upgrades. A novel feature of our study is that we deploy large numbers of data loggers which allow us to measure temperature and humidity at high frequency inside homes. We ﬁnd that the upgrades had no detectable impact on electricity use or thermal comfort, with essentially identical temperature and humidity levels in upgraded and non-upgraded homes. These results stand in sharp contrast to the engineering estimates that predicted considerable improvements in thermal comfort and up to a 26\% decrease in electricity use. As we document, part of the explanation is that most households have their windows open on hot days, nullifying the thermal beneﬁts of roof and wall insulation. Overall, we conclude that the beneﬁts from these investments are unlikely to exceed the costs, which added \$650-\$850 {USD} to the cost of each home. Our results underscore the urgent need to fully incorporate human behavior into engineering models of energy use.},

By placing uniform restrictions on all cars, many of these programs have created incentives for drivers to buy additional, more polluting cars. We study vintage-specific restrictions, which place heavy limits on older, polluting vehicles and no limits on newer, cleaner ones. We use a novel model of the car market and results from Santiago’s 1992 program, the earliest program to use vintage-specific restrictions, to show that such restrictions should be designed to work exclusively through the extensive margin (type of car driven), never through the intensive margin (number of miles driven). If so, vintage restrictions can yield important welfare gains by moving the fleet composition toward cleaner cars, comparing well to alternative instruments such as scrappage subsidies and pollution-based registration fees.},

As the investor obtains a more precise estimate of the uncertain clean-up costs, the investor faces less risk; therefore, the investor’s risk premium falls and the investor’s bid rises.

However, relatively little evidence exists on the                     deterrence effect.

We focus on whether a patient receives a major intervention in the form of either a coronary artery by-pass or angioplasty. We find strong evidence that treatment intensity declines after a cap on non-economic damages. The probability of receiving a major intervention in the form of either an angioplasty or bypass declines by 1.25–2 percentage points after non-economic damage caps are enacted, and this effect is larger a year or two after reform. However, we also find clear evidence of substitution between major interventions. When doctors have discretion to perform a by-pass and patients have insurance coverage, caps on non-economic damages increase the probability that a by-pass is performed. The effect of non-economic damage caps on costs is not always statistically significant, but in models with state-specific trends, total costs decline by as much as four percent. We conclude that tort reform reduces treatment intensity overall, even though it changes the mix of treatments. Using the Center for Disease Control's Vital Statistics data, we find that tort reform is not associated with an increase in mortality from coronary heart disease; if anything, mortality declines.},

We find that this does not appear to be true for a large and important class of cases—childbirth in the United States. Using data from national vital statistics natality files on millions of individual births from 1989 to 2001, we ask whether specific tort reforms affect the types of procedures that are performed, and the health outcomes of mothers and their infants. We find that reform of the Joint and Several Liability rule (or the “deep pockets rule”) reduces complications of labor and procedure use, whereas caps on noneconomic damages increase them. We show that these results are consistent with a model of tort reform that explicitly allows for variations in patient condition.},

Due to these externalities, economic agents invest too little in prevention relative to the socially efficient level by ignoring marginal external costs or benefits conferred on others. This paper analyzes an insurance market with externalities of loss prevention. It is shown in a model with heterogenous agents and imperfect information that a monopolistic insurer can achieve the social optimum by engaging in premium discrimination. An insurance monopoly reduces not only costs of risk selection, but may also play an important social role in loss prevention.},

We allow for the planner to attach diﬀerent relative weights to the discounted and end-of-planning-horizon costs in order to assess how sustainability concern might aﬀect the optimal level of policy intervention. We show that the optimal environmental policy increases with the degree of sustainability concern, reducing thus the amount of pollution the society is forced to bear. A calibration based on world {CO}2 data supports our conclusions, further highlighting the importance of higher degrees of sustainability concern to achieve greener long run outcomes. It also allows us to show that under a realistic model’s parametrization the optimal environmental policy tends to rise with higher degrees of uncertainty in a precautionary manner.},

It follows that the higher the degree of uncertainty, the more aggressive this preventive action should be. This normative maxim is explored in the case of a stylized dynamic model of pollution control with uncertain (in the Knightian sense) stock dynamics, using the robust control framework of Hansen and Sargent [12]. Optimal investment in damage control is found to be increasing in the degree of uncertainty, thus confirming the conventional {PP} wisdom. Optimal mitigation decisions, however, need not always comport with the {PP}. In particular, when damage-control investment is both sufficiently cheap and sensitive to changes in uncertainty, damage-control investment and mitigation may act as substitutes and a {PP} with respect to the latter can be unambiguously irrational. The theoretical results are applied to a calibrated linear-quadratic model of climate change. The analysis suggests that a reversal of the {PP} with respect to mitigation, while theoretically possible, is very unlikely.},

Recent analysis of irreversible events is extended to two types of reversible events: single-occurrence and multiple-occurrence (recurrent) events. While it is possible that the threat of irreversible events induces more pollution, we show that reversible events, under quite general conditions, induce more conservation (less pollution). The analysis is carried out via a simple method (the ‘hδ-method’) to identify optimal steady states by comparing steady state policies with small variations from them. For recurrent events the optimal state process must approach a unique steady state from any initial level. In this case, the hδ-method characterizes the dynamic behavior of the optimal state process without actually solving for it.},

We analyze a panel of 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia for 1970–98, a period in which many states adopted compulsory insurance regulations and/or no‐fault laws. Using an instrumental variables approach, we find evidence that automobile insurance has moral hazard costs, leading to an increase in traffic fatalities. We also find that reductions in accident liability produced by no‐fault liability laws have led to an increase in traffic fatalities (estimated to be on the order of 6 percent). Overall, our results indicate that, whatever other benefits they might produce, increases in the incidence of automobile insurance and moves to no‐fault liability systems have significant negative effects on traffic fatalities.},

We find that the adoption of {ELI} policies significantly reduces firms' efforts in treating water pollution.

We further find that the negative effect is lessened for firms in strictly supervised regions and for firms with strong environmental awareness.

	abstract = {Natural gas producers are constantly making tradeoffs between money, time, and           environmental risk. The private costs and benefits of drilling are realized immediately,           but the external costs are not. This means that by the time external costs are well           understood, producers may no longer exist or may not have sufficient resources to finance           necessary cleanups or to compensate those who have been adversely affected. Because           producers do not face the total cost of potential external damages, they may take too many           risks. This article discusses alternative regulatory approaches for mitigating moral           hazard in U.S. natural gas production. Particular emphasis is given to bonding           requirements, which have tended to receive less attention from policy makers than other           approaches but have a long history. Although the use of bonding has important limitations,           this approach is quite well suited to addressing many of the environmental risks in this           market.

We find that environmental insurance can achieve social efficiency even when two traditional policy instruments—ex post fines and risk management mandates with ex ante fines—do not. Inefficiency occurs with ex post fines, when small firms declare bankruptcy and escape their liabilities, limiting the incentives from this policy tool. Firms ignore mandates to implement efficient risk management because regulatory agencies do not have sufficient resources to monitor every firm. The evolution of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's and states’ underground storage tank programs suggests that mandating environmental insurance can address inefficiency due to small firms declaring bankruptcy. Comparing insurance mandates to risk management mandates, the burden on a regulator is lower if all it has to do is to confirm that the firm has insurance rather than that the firm has actually, and effectively, implemented required management practices. For underground storage tanks, we show that insurance lowered toxic releases.},

	abstract = {Complex Machine Learning ({ML}) models can be effective at analyzing large amounts of data and driving business value. However, these models can be nonintuitive, their parameters meaningless, their potential biases difficult to detect and even harder to mitigate, and their predictions and decisions difficult to explain. Lenders, regulators, and customers need explainable models for automating credit decisions. Lack of algorithmic transparency is a broad concern beyond lending, which has led to much interest in “explainable artificial intelligence” [1]. This paper discusses a model family which warrants explainability and transparency by design: the Transparent Generalized Additive Model Tree ({TGAMT}). Many credit risk models used in the {US} and internationally belong to this family. Today, these credit scores are developed painstakingly by teams of data scientists and credit risk experts in a tedious interplay of “art and science” in order to simultaneously achieve high predictive performance and intuitive explanations of how the scores are arrived at. The main contribution of this paper is to automate the learning of {TGAMT} models. We also report benchmark results indicating that {TGAMT}’s achieve strong predictive performance similar to complex {ML} models while being more explanation-friendly.},

	abstract = {New technologies have enabled ﬁrms to elicit granular behavioral data from consumers in exchange for lower prices and better experiences. This data can mitigate asymmetric information and moral hazard, but it may also increase ﬁrms’ market power if kept proprietary. We study a voluntary monitoring program by a major U.S. auto insurer, in which drivers accept short-term tracking in exchange for potential discounts on future premiums. Using a proprietary dataset matched with competitor price menus, we document that safer drivers self-select into monitoring, and those who opt-in become yet 30\% safer while monitored. Using an equilibrium model of consumer choice and ﬁrm pricing for insurance and monitoring, we ﬁnd that the monitoring program generates large proﬁt and welfare gains. However, large demand frictions hurt monitoring adoption, forcing the ﬁrm to offer large discounts to induce opt-in while preventing the unmonitored pool from unraveling given the competitive environment. A counterfactual policy requiring the ﬁrm to make monitoring data public would thus further reduce the ﬁrm’s incentive to elicit monitoring data, leading to less monitoring and lower consumer welfare in equilibrium.},

To perform these functions efficiently, insurers need to access high quality information about disaster risk and set prices that accurately reflect the costs of insuring this risk. We use proprietary data on parcel-level wildfire risk, together with insurance premiums derived from insurers' regulatory filings, to investigate how insurance is priced and provided in a large market for homeowners insurance. We document striking variation in insurers' risk pricing strategies. Firms that rely on coarser measures of wildfire risk charge relatively high prices in high-risk market segments -- or choose not to serve these areas at all. Empirical results are consistent with a winner's curse, where firms with less granular pricing strategies face higher expected losses. A theoretical model of a market for natural hazard insurance that incorporates both price regulation and asymmetric information across insurers helps rationalize the empirical patterns we document. Our results highlight the underappreciated importance of the winner's curse as a driver of high prices and limited participation in insurance markets for large, hard-to-model risks.},

I evaluate the welfare costs of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act on the U.S. Portland cement industry, accounting for these effects through a dynamic model of oligopoly in the tradition of Ericson and Pakes (1995). Using the two-step estimator of Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007), I recover the entire cost structure of the industry, including the distributions of sunk entry costs and capacity adjustment costs. My primary ﬁnding is that the Amendments have signiﬁcantly increased the sunk cost of entry, leading to a loss of between \$810M and \$3.2B in product market surplus. A static analysis misses the welfare penalty on consumers, and obtains the wrong sign of the welfare effects on incumbent ﬁrms.},

We define a new equilibrium concept that we call oblivious equilibrium, in which each firm is assumed to make decisions based only on its own state and knowledge of the long-run average industry state, but where firms ignore current information about competitors' states. The great advantage of oblivious equilibria is that they are much easier to compute than are Markov perfect equilibria. Moreover, we show that, as the market becomes large, if the equilibrium distribution of firm states obeys a certain "light-tail" condition, then oblivious equilibria closely approximate Markov perfect equilibria. This theorem justifies using oblivious equilibria to analyze Markov perfect industry dynamics in Ericson and Pakes (1995)-style models with many firms.},

Three-quarters of marginal auction winners are not additional. Heterogeneity in counterfactual land use introduces adverse selection. We develop a model of bidding and additionality to quantify welfare implications. Alternative auctions increase eﬃciency by using scoring rules that incorporate expected land use impacts.},

In the transition to new compliance standards, individual states have taken advantage of provisions in federal regulations to implement their own programs. This raises the policy question of environmental federalism and the appropriate locus of government control. The objectives of this study are to examine the revealed preferences of a state {UST} bureau. New Mexico was one of the first state programs to use risk assessments in setting funding priorities. We analyze the statistical determinants of funding decisions and find strong evidence that risk information is used. Although our case study provides a measure of support for state control, the argument is strengthened if public financing is limited to the cleanup of historical pollution, rather than a means for providing insurance for prospective pollution. ©1999 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

To bound the true implicit prices, researchers sometimes study highprofile cases involving significant media and community attention. However, prior research finds that high-profile cases may lead to “stigma” effects that can confound interpretation of the results. This study compares these opposing effects at sixteen of the highest profile underground storage tank releases across the United States over the last thirty years. Using covariate matching and difference-in-differences hedonic regressions, we estimate the change in housing values around each site. We then conduct a cross-site meta-analysis to estimate the average treatment effects. We find an average housing price depreciation of 2–6\% upon discovery of a release, which is an upper bound on the implicit price of contamination at more typical sites. Following cleanup, we find a housing price appreciation of a similar magnitude, suggesting that even in high-profile cases, surrounding neighborhoods do not experience persistent stigma.},

We find that only incidents that are both severe (involving explosion, ignition, or fatalities) and occurred on above-ground pipelines, which we define as high-profile incidents, have adverse effects on nearby property values, while other incidents have no measurable housing price effect. A difference-in-differences analysis finds that high-profile incidents significantly decrease property values within 1000 m by 8.2\%, and the negative impact can persist for about eight years on average. Furthermore, we find a drop in transaction volume that lasts a short period after the incidents, suggesting an initial demand-side response. In contrast to the strong effects of pipeline incidents, we do not find statistically significant price effects from pipeline installation. We also demonstrate that there is substantial heterogeneity by the type of incident and that results based on studies of individual incidents should be generalized with caution.},

The study focuses on facilities regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ({EPA}) Risk Management Plan ({RMP}) program, which is in place to reduce the risk of harm to offsite populations from accidental chemical fires, explosions, and releases of toxic vapors. {RMP} facility and accident data were linked to residential property transactions in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania occurring between 2004 and 2014. To facilitate causal inference, alternative quasi-experimental difference-in-differences and triple differences models are estimated, where we compare homes near and far, and before and after, an accident; as well as homes near {RMP} facilities where an accident did and did not occur. We find that the typical accident does not affect home values, but accidents resulting in offsite injuries, property damage, evacuations, or shelter-in-place orders lead to a 5\% to 7\% decrease in the value of homes within five kilometers, this translates to an average loss of \$12,000 to \$17,000 per home. The benefits of the {RMP} program in avoiding these impacts are particularly relevant from an environmental justice standpoint. We find that proximity to an {RMP} facility, irrespective of any incidents, is already associated with significantly lower home values. These existing inequities are exacerbated by chemical accidents that impact offsite populations.},

The conclusions are in essence that although both of the forms of liability create incentives to take care, they differ in respect to the allocation of risk; that, of course, the presence of insurance markets mitigates this difference and alters incentives to take care; and that despite the latter effect, the sale of insurance is socially desirable.},

	abstract = {New technologies have enabled ﬁrms to elicit granular behavioral data from consumers in exchange for lower prices and better experiences. This data can mitigate asymmetric information and moral hazard, but it may also increase ﬁrms’ market power if kept proprietary. We study a voluntary monitoring program by a major U.S. auto insurer, in which drivers accept short-term tracking in exchange for potential discounts on future premiums. Using a proprietary dataset matched with competitor price menus, we document that safer drivers self-select into monitoring, and those who opt-in become yet 30\% safer while monitored. Using an equilibrium model of consumer choice and ﬁrm pricing for insurance and monitoring, we ﬁnd that the monitoring program generates large proﬁt and welfare gains. However, large demand frictions hurt monitoring adoption, forcing the ﬁrm to offer large discounts to induce opt-in while preventing the unmonitored pool from unraveling given the competitive environment. A counterfactual policy requiring the ﬁrm to make monitoring data public would thus further reduce the ﬁrm’s incentive to elicit monitoring data, leading to less monitoring and lower consumer welfare in equilibrium.},

	abstract = {The 2009 {CARD} Act limited credit card lenders’ ability to raise borrowers’ interest rates on the basis of new information. Pricing became less responsive to public and private signals of borrowers’ risk and demand characteristics, and price dispersion fell by one third. I estimate the efficiency and distributional effects of this shift away from personalized pricing. Prices fell for high-risk and price-inelastic consumers, but prices rose elsewhere in the market and newly exceeded willingness to pay for over 30\% of the safest subprime borrowers. On net, average traded prices fell and consumer surplus rose at all credit scores. Higher consumer surplus was partly driven by a fall in lender profits, and partly by the Act’s insurance value to borrowers who could retain favorable pricing after adverse changes to their default risk. The relatively high level of pre-{CARD}-Act markups was crucial for realizing these surplus gains. {JEL} Codes: D18, D22, D43, G21, G28, L13, L14, L51.},

This pairing of natural and randomized experiments allows us to separately identify how new information enters on the supply and the demand sides of the market. Our results indicate that the credit bureau generated large efficiency gains for the lender, and that these gains were augmented when borrowers understood the rules of the game. The credit bureau rewarded good borrowers but penalized weaker ones, increasing economic differentiation.},

In 2004, Medicare began to risk-adjust capitation payments to private Medicare Advantage ({MA}) plans to reduce selection-driven overpayments. But because the variance of medical costs increases with the predicted mean, incentivizing enrollment of individuals with higher scores can increase the scope for enrolling “overpriced” individuals with costs significantly below the formula's prediction. Indeed, after risk adjustment, {MA} plans enrolled individuals with higher scores but lower costs conditional on their score. We find no evidence that overpayments were on net reduced.

	abstract = {Health plans participating in the Medicare managed care program, called Medicare Advantage since 2003, have historically attracted healthier enrollees than has the traditional fee-for-service program. Medicare Advantage plans have gained financially from this favorable risk selection since their payments have traditionally been adjusted only minimally for clinical characteristics of enrollees, causing overpayment for healthier enrollees and underpayment for sicker ones. As a result, a new risk-adjustment system was phased in from 2004 to 2007, and a lock-in provision instituted to limit midyear disenrollment by enrollees experiencing health declines whose exodus could benefit plans financially. To determine whether these reforms were associated with intended reductions in risk selection, we compared differences in self-reported health care use and health between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare beneficiaries before versus after these reforms were implemented. We similarly compared differences between those who switched into or out of Medicare Advantage and nonswitchers. Most differences in 2001-03 were substantially narrowed by 2006-07, suggesting reduced selection. Similar risk-adjustment methods may help reduce incentives for plans competing in health insurance exchanges and accountable care organizations to select patients with favorable clinical risks.},

Using a novel theoretical framework and an empirical analysis of homes impacted by petroleum releases from underground storage tanks, this paper demonstrates that changes in environmental quality can significantly impact a household’s decision to sell their home, and that this change in behavior has important implications towards theoretical welfare measures and empirical estimates. A discrete time duration model is estimated using a panel of single-family homes from 2000 to 2007. The dependent variable is the annual occurrence of a sale at each individual home. I find that contamination and cleanup activities in close proximity significantly impact the probability that a home is sold. Most striking is that this probability is reduced by about 50\% during ongoing cleanup. This finding is most pronounced among lower quality homes and where an exposure pathway is present.},

The data indicate that eliminating a state-level government assurance program and switching to private insurance markets to finance cleanups reduce the frequency of underground fuel tank leaks by more than 20 percent. This corresponds to more than 3,000 fuel tank release accidents forgone over 8 years in one state alone, a benefit in avoided cleanup costs exceeding \$400 million. These benefits arise because private insurers mitigate moral hazard by providing financial incentives for tank owners to close or replace leak-prone tanks prior to costly accidents.},

Using panel data on the universe of bank borrowers in Chile combined with the deleted registry information, we implement machine learning techniques to measure changes in the predictions lenders can make about default rates following deletion. Deletion lowers (raises) predicted default the most for poorer defaulters (non-defaulters) with limited borrowing histories. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that individuals exposed to increases in predicted default reduce borrowing by 6.4\% following deletion, while those exposed to decreases raise borrowing by 11.8\%. In aggregate, deletion reduces borrowing by 3.5\%. Taking the difference-in-difference estimates as inputs into a model of borrowing under adverse selection, we find that deletion reduces surplus under a variety of assumptions about lenders' pricing strategies.},

This paper argues private information, held by the potential applicant pool, explains rejections. I formulate this argument by developing and testing a model in which agents may have private information about their risk. I first derive a new no-trade result that theoretically explains how private information could cause rejections. I then develop a new empirical methodology to test whether this no-trade condition can explain rejections. The methodology uses subjective probability elicitations as noisy measures of agents beliefs. I apply this approach to three non-group markets: long-term care, disability, and life insurance. Consistent with the predictions of the theory, in all three settings I find significant amounts of private information held by those who would be rejected; I find generally more private information for those who would be rejected relative to those who can purchase insurance; and I show it is enough private information to explain a complete absence of trade for those who would be rejected. The results suggest private information prevents the existence of large segments of these three major insurance markets.{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}small{\textgreater}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.){\textless}/small{\textgreater}},

We find that environmental insurance can achieve social efficiency even when two traditional policy instruments—ex post fines and risk management mandates with ex ante fines—do not. Inefficiency occurs with ex post fines, when small firms declare bankruptcy and escape their liabilities, limiting the incentives from this policy tool. Firms ignore mandates to implement efficient risk management because regulatory agencies do not have sufficient resources to monitor every firm. The evolution of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's and states’ underground storage tank programs suggests that mandating environmental insurance can address inefficiency due to small firms declaring bankruptcy. Comparing insurance mandates to risk management mandates, the burden on a regulator is lower if all it has to do is to confirm that the firm has insurance rather than that the firm has actually, and effectively, implemented required management practices. For underground storage tanks, we show that insurance lowered toxic releases.},
