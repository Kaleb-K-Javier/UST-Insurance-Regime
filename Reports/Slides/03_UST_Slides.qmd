## Motivation: Mispricing Environmental Risk

\BerkeleyLightMode

**The Market Failure**

- Median cleanup cost $> \\$100{,}000$; uniform premiums $\bar{P}$ mute risk incentives.
- Strict liability internalizes risk only if priced: $P_i \propto Risk_i$ (Shavell, 1982).

**The Technological Friction**

- Single-walled tanks (high-risk) persist: 48% of stock.
- Double-walled replacement costs 60–90% more (GAO, 1987).


**The "Texas Experiment" (1999)**

- **Shock:** Policy forces 100% of owners into risk-rated private market.

## Research Question & Contribution

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Research Question**

Does replacing Uniform Premium public insurance with risk-based pricing induce firms to internalize environmental damages?

**Contribution 1: Mechanism**

Firms respond to risk-based premiums by *substituting capital*, not just exiting. High-risk tanks are scrapped; low-risk tanks retained.

**Contribution 2: Policy**

Privatizing liability reduces leak probability by **XX pp** — market pricing is an compliment to direct regulation.


---


## Preview of Findings

\BerkeleyLightMode

**1. Acceleration of Closures**

Transition to risk-based pricing increased annual closure rates of single-walled tanks by XX–XX percentage points.

**2. Technology Substitution (Not Just Exit)**

Closures shifted from market exit to on-site replacement: exit probability (conditional on closure) decreased ~xx pp; replacement probability increased ~xx pp.

**3. Environmental Improvement**

Probability of a reported leak **fell** by ~XX percentage point.

-   *Note:* Represents near-total elimination of pre-policy baseline risk for this group.

## Underground Storage Tank (UST) Regulatory Context: 1990–2025

\BerkeleyLightMode

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Federal Baseline (Constant)**

All states face identical EPA technical mandates:

- **1998:** Retrofit deadline — upgrade or close non-compliant tanks.
- **2005:** Energy Policy Act — 3-year inspections, secondary containment.

These rules apply equally to Texas and all control states throughout the sample period.

**Texas Divergence (Financial Rules Only)**

| Period | Controls | Texas |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pre-1999** | Public Fund ($\bar{P}$) | Public Fund ($\bar{P}$) |
| **1999** | *Status Quo* | **Fund Closes** |
| **Post-1999** | Public Fund ($\bar{P}$) | Private Market ($P_{it}$) |

## The Agent's Decision

\BerkeleyLightMode

**The Choice**

Each period $t$, the facility chooses: $d_t \in \{\text{Maintain}, \text{Close}\}$

**The Trade-off**


-   **Maintain:** Earn net revenue, pay insurance premiums.
-   **Close:** Exit market and recover scrap value $\kappa$ (liquidity of land).

**Flow Utility (Maintain)**
$$
u(a) = \underbrace{R}_{\text{Net Revenue}} - \underbrace{C_j(a)}_{\text{Insurance Premium}}
$$

\begin{assumptionbox}{Simplifying Assumption: Full Coverage}
Firms face environmental risk solely as an \textit{ex-ante} cost (premium), not an \textit{ex-post} shock (deductible).
\end{assumptionbox}

---

## The Dynamic Problem

\BerkeleyLightMode

**The Bellman Equation**

$$
V(a) = \max \Bigg\{ \underbrace{u(a) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(a') \mid a]}_{\text{Value of Maintaining}}, \quad \underbrace{\kappa}_{\text{Scrap Value}} \Bigg\}
$$

**The Continuation Value ($V_{cont}$)**
The value of keeping the tank active today to preserve the option of operating tomorrow:
$$
V_{cont}(a) = u(a) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(a') \mid a]
$$

**Optimal Stopping Rule**
$$
\text{Close if } \quad V_{cont}(a) < \kappa
$$

---


## The Policy Lever: Insurance Regimes

\BerkeleyLightMode

**1. Uniform Premium Pooling ($F$)**

-   **Premium:** Constant $\bar{P}$.
-   **Incentive:** Zero marginal cost of aging.
$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \text{Age}} = 0
$$

**2. Risk-Based Pricing ($RB$)**

- **Premium:** Rises with leak hazard $h(a)$, the instantaneous probability of a leak, strictly increasing in age.
- **Incentive:** Positive marginal cost of aging.
$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \text{Age}} > 0
$$

---

## The Benchmark: Social Value & Market Failure

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Social Planner's Objective**

Internalize *all* damages, including health externalities ($E$):

$$
u_{SOC}(a) = R - h(a) \cdot (\underbrace{L}_{\text{Remediation}} + \underbrace{E}_{\text{Health Damages}})
$$

**Why Risk-Based Pricing is Second Best**

RB premiums are calibrated from insurer claims data, which reflect remediation costs ($L$) only. Health and property damages ($E$) are *structurally absent* from pricing: affected parties are unaware of contamination, so no third-party claims inform actuarial tables (Marcus, 2021).

$\Rightarrow$ Even actuarially fair RB pricing leaves $E$ fully externalized.

Let $V_{RB}(a)$ and $V_{SOC}(a)$ denote continuation values under risk-based pricing and full social internalization, respectively:

$$
V_{RB}(a) > V_{SOC}(a) \;\; \forall \, a \quad \text{because} \quad h(a) \cdot L < h(a)(L + E)
$$

---

##  The Efficiency Gap

\BerkeleyLightMode

**1. Fact: Asset Depreciation**

Rising leak risk causes tank value to strictly decrease in age ($V'(a) < 0$).

* *Economic Friction:* The regime determines if private incentives align with this social decay.

**2. Inefficient Retention (Uniform Premium)**

-   **Mechanism:** Static costs ($\bar{P}$) $\implies$ Zero marginal cost of aging.
-   **Result:** Firm ignores risk; retains asset longest ($a^*_{UP}$).


**3. Partial Correction (Risk-Based)**

-   **Mechanism:** Rising premiums ($h(a)L$) $\implies$ Positive marginal cost of aging.
-   **Result:** Accelerated exit ($a^*_{RB}$), yet strictly $>$ $a^*_{SOC}$ due to unpriced health costs.

**The Ordering**

$$
a^*_{SOC} < a^*_{RB} < a^*_{UP}
$$

## From Theory to Empirics

\BerkeleyLightMode

**H1: Risk Selection (The Mechanism)**
\textbf{Theory:} Risk-based pricing steepens the optimal stopping curve.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metric:} The \textit{Closure Hazard Gradient} (Slope).
    \item \textbf{Prediction:} The marginal effect of risk factors on the hazard rate increases.
    \item \textbf{Test:} $\beta_{Tx \times Post \times Risk} > 0$ in a \textbf{Cox Proportional Hazards Model}.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

**H2: Correction of Misallocation (The Level)**
\textbf{Theory:} The regime shift flushes the accumulated backlog of inefficient capital ($a^*_{FF} \gg a^*_{RB}$).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metric:} The \textit{Aggregate Closure Probability} (Level).
    \item \textbf{Prediction:} A discrete jump in the extensive margin of exit.
    \item \textbf{Test:} $ATT > 0$ in a \textbf{Facility-Level Linear Probability Model}.
\end{itemize}

---

## What about the Pollution?

\BerkeleyLightMode

**The Empirical Challenge**

Observable leak counts (LUST) conflate **true risk** with **measurement effort**.

**1. The Detection Effect (Reporting $\uparrow$)**

* **Monitoring:** Insurers mandate inspections $\to$ detection of *existing* leaks.
* **Closure:** Mandatory site assessments $\to$ discovery of *historical* contamination.
* *Outcome:* Short-run spike in reported incidents.

**2. The Prevention Effect (True Risk $\downarrow$)**

* **Selection:** High premiums force inefficient, high-risk tanks to exit.
* **Upgrade:** Single-walled tanks replaced with double-walled tech.
* *Outcome:* Long-run decline in leak probability.

**Net Result:** A safer tank fleet, initially masked by increased reporting.

\vspace{0.3cm}

::: {.callout-note}
**Implication for Identification:**
The high prevalence of **Single-Walled** and **Pre-1980** tanks in the incumbent stock provides the necessary variation to identify the "Risk Selection" slope ($\beta_2$).
:::

---

## Identification: Risk Selection (H1)

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Model 1: Structural Hazard Gradient (The Slope)**
To test if pricing risk alters behavior (H1), we estimate a Cox Proportional Hazards model with risk interactions:

$$
h_{jt}(t) = h_0(t) \exp\Big( \beta_1 (\text{TX} \times \text{Post}) + \mathbf{\beta_2 (\text{TX} \times \text{Post} \times \text{Risk}_{jt})} + \mathbf{X}_{jt}\gamma \Big)
$$

**Specification Details**

* **Target ($\beta_2$):** Tests if the closure hazard \textit{steepens} for high-risk tanks (Age $>20$, Single-Walled).
* **Inference:** Stratified by county $h_{0c}(t)$; Clustered by state ($G=19$).

**Identifying Assumption**

\textbf{No Differential Sorting:} The correlation between tank risk (e.g., age) and closure probability would have remained constant relative to controls absent the policy shock.

---

## Identification: Misallocation Correction (H2)

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Model 2: Reduced Form DiD (The Level)**
To test if the regime shift clears the inefficient backlog (H2), we estimate the aggregate extensive margin response:

$$
Y_{it} = \mathbf{\beta_1 (\text{TX}_i \times \text{Post}_t)} + \alpha_i + \delta_t + \mathbf{X}_{it}\gamma + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

**Specification Details**

* **Outcome ($Y_{it}$):** Binary Closure Indicator (1 = Closed any tank in year $t$).
* **Target ($\beta_1$):** Tests for a level shift (intercept) in the exit rate.
* **Inference:** Wild Cluster Bootstrap (Webb-6 Weights).

**Identifying Assumption**

\textbf{Parallel Trends:} In the absence of the insurance reform, the trend in closure rates in Texas would have evolved in parallel to the control states.

## Identification: Aggregate Environmental Response

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Specification: Dynamic Event Study**
To establish the aggregate effect of the policy on leak reporting, we estimate the dynamic difference-in-differences specification:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \delta_t + \sum_{k=-5}^{10} \beta_k \cdot (\mathbb{1}[t - 1999 = k] \times \text{TX}_i) + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

**Components**

* **Outcome ($Y_{it}$):** Count of \textbf{New LUST Reports} filed in facility $i$ in year $t$ (Inverse Hyperbolic Sine).
* **Coefficients ($\beta_k$):** Measures the differential leak rate in Texas relative to controls $k$ years from the policy shock (omitting $k=-1$).

## Mechanism 1: The Detection Channel 

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Hypothesis:** The spike is driven by "Revealed Leaks"—historical contamination discovered solely because the tank was forced to close.

**Specification: Conditional Logit on Closure**
$$
P(Y_{j} = 1 \mid \text{Close}_j) = \Lambda \Big( \alpha + \beta_1 (\text{TX}_j \times \text{Post}_j) + \mathbf{X}_j \gamma \Big)
$$

**Outcome Definition ($Y_j$)**

* **Revealed Leak:** Binary indicator $= 1$ if a leak report is filed for tank $j$ within the **decommissioning window** (0–5 years post-closure).
* **Population:** Restricted to \textit{closed} tanks.

**Interpretation**

* **$\beta_1 > 0$ (Odds Ratio $> 1$):** Texas closures are significantly more likely to reveal contamination than control closures.
* **Implication:** The policy forces the internalization of \textit{latent} stock externalities.

---

## Mechanism 2: The Prevention Channel 

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Hypothesis:** Conditional on remaining active, the "surviving" fleet is safer due to the exit of high-risk tanks (Selection) and upgrades (Retrofit).

**Specification: Cause-Specific Operational Hazard**
$$
h_{jt}^{\text{leak}}(t) = h_0(t) \exp \Big( \beta_1 (\text{TX} \times \text{Post}) + \mathbf{X}_{jt} \gamma \Big)
$$

**Outcome Definition ($h_{jt}$)**

* **Operational Leak Hazard:** The instantaneous probability of a leak occurring while the tank is \textit{active} (operating).
* **Competing Risk:** Tank Closure is treated as a competing event (censoring the operational leak observation).

**Interpretation**

* **$\beta_1 < 0$ (Hazard Ratio $< 1$):** The active fleet in Texas has a lower risk of failure than the control fleet.
* **Implication:** The long-run effect of the policy is an improvement in environmental safety (Prevention).

| **Outcome**    | Reported LUSTs       | **+XX.X \%** | Detection > Prevention (Short Run) |

<!-- 
**Back-of-the-Envelope: What does this mean?**

* **The Coefficient:** A $+\text{0.0X}$ effect on closure probability.
* **The Scale:** Applied to $\approx \text{70,000}$ incumbent tanks in Texas.
* **The Impact:**
    $$ \text{0.0X} \times \text{70,000} \approx \textbf{2,XXX Accelerated Closures} $$
* **Economic Value:** At median remediation cost (\$150k), this represents **$\approx \$\text{XXX} \text{ Million}$** in environmental liability internalized by private firms rather than dumped on the public trust. -->

        \item \textbf{Age ($A$):} 9 bins (0-5y ... 40y+).

        \item \textbf{Close ($d=c$)}
        \begin{itemize}

    \end{enumerate}
}

\vspace{0.5cm}

1. Facility observes state $x_t$ and shock $\varepsilon_{it}$ (Type I EV).
2. Chooses $d_{it}$ to maximize expected discounted value ($\beta = 0.95$).

## Bellman Equation & Flow Utility

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Optimal Stopping Problem**
$$
V(x) = \max\left\{ \underbrace{u^m(x) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(x') | x, m]}_{\textbf{Maintain (Continuation)}}, \quad \underbrace{\Est{\kappa}}_{\textbf{Close (Scrap)}} \right\} + \sigma\varepsilon
$$

**Flow Utility (Normalized)**
$$
u^m(x) = \underbrace{1}_{\textbf{Revenue}} - \underbrace{\Est{\gamma_{p}} \cdot p(x)}_{\textbf{Premium}} - \underbrace{\Est{\gamma_{r}} \cdot h(x) \cdot L}_{\textbf{Liability}}
$$


### Scaling & Interpretation

- **Numeraire:** Annual net revenue is normalized to $\psi = 1$.
- **Unit Interpretation:** - Estimated parameters $\{\Est{\kappa}, \Est{\gamma}\}$ are expressed in **multiples of annual revenue**.
  - A value of $\Est{\gamma_r} = 0.5$ implies the marginal liability risk is equivalent to 6 months of revenue.

---

## Identification of Parameters

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Which Variation Identifies Which Parameter?**

| Parameter | Interpretation | Source of Variation |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| $\Est{\kappa}$ | Scrap Value | Average facility exit rate (Unconditional Levels) |
| $\Est{\gamma_{p}}$ | Premium Sensitivity | Cross-sectional premium jumps across $(A, w, \rho)$ |
| $\Est{\gamma_{r}}$ | Liability Sensitivity | Variation in deductible sizes & coverage limits |

\vspace{0.2cm}

**Estimation Protocol**

- **Algorithm:** Nested Pseudo-Likelihood (NPL) \footnotesize{(Aguirregabiria & Mira, 2007)}
- **Standard Errors:** Facility-level block bootstrap ($B=999$).
- **Sample:** [Insert N] facilities observed quarterly (20XX-20XX).

| $\hat{\kappa}$ | 6.25 | (0.84) | Scrap value (annual revenue units) |
| $\hat{\gamma}_{price}$ | −1.20 | (0.31) | Firms dislike premiums (Price Elastic) |
| $\hat{\gamma}_{risk}$ | 1.00 | (0.22) | Near-perfect private internalization |
:::

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Interpretation**

- **Price Sensitivity ($\gamma < 0$)** Firms respond strongly to premium hikes ($p < 0.01$).
- **Risk Neutrality ($\gamma \approx 1$)** Owners fully internalize *private* costs (deductibles), implying the remaining distortion is purely the **external** damage.

**Ranking:** Social Optimum $>$ Subsidy $>$ Mandate $>$ Baseline

## Conclusion & Policy Implications

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Findings**

1. **Risk-based pricing works** +2–3 pp closure rates (DiD)
2. **Mechanism is upgrading, not abandonment** Retrofit substitution
3. **Welfare-improving but not First Best** Gap to Social Optimum remains

**Policy Recommendations**

- Risk-based insurance dominates Uniform Premium pooling
- Targeted **closure subsidies** for high-risk tanks can close remaining welfare gap
- **Mandates** are less efficient (distort margins not requiring intervention)

**Broader Implication** Market-based environmental regulation can outperform command-and-control when behavioral elasticities are sufficient.
