## Motivation

\BerkeleyMode

**Why Underground Storage Tanks Matter:**

- 580,000+ regulated USTs nationwide (EPA, 2023)
- Primary source of groundwater contamination (EPA, 2023)
- Median cleanup cost: \$250,000–\$500,000 per site
- Long-tail risk: contamination discovered decades after installation

**The Policy Tension:**

| Regime | Premium Structure | Incentive Problem |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Flat-Fee | $p^F = \bar{p}$ | Moral hazard; no risk signal |
| Risk-Based | $p^{RB}(a, w)$ | Price signal; may distort exit |

## Research Question & Contribution

\BerkeleyMode

**Research Question:**

How does pricing environmental risk affect facility exit and technology adoption decisions?

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Contributions:**

1. **Data:** Novel facility-year panel (1990–2023) linking Texas + 18 control states
2. **Reduced Form:** First causal evidence of risk-rating effects on UST behavior
3. **Structural:** Dynamic model quantifying welfare gains ($W_{RB} \gtrless W_{FF}$?)

---

## Preview of Findings

\BerkeleyMode

**Reduced Form (DiD):**

- Risk-based pricing increased annual closure probability by ~2–3 pp
- Firms substituted toward **Retrofit** rather than pure Exit
- Leak detection rates rose ~1 pp (environmental benefit)

**Structural Dynamic Discrete Chocie Model :**

- Price sensitivity: $\hat{\gamma}_{price} < 0$ (firms respond to premiums)
- Risk internalization: $\hat{\gamma}_{risk} \approx 1$ (near-full private cost internalization)
- Counterfactuals: Targeted subsidies outperform mandates

---

## Institutional Context: The 1999 Texas Reform

\BerkeleyMode

**Pre-1999: State-Run Flat-Fee Insurance**

- Uniform premium regardless of tank age/type
- Low deductibles ($D_F \approx 0.1L$)
- Implicit cross-subsidy from safe to risky facilities

**Post-1999: Private Risk-Based Market**

- Premiums vary with age, wall type, and claims history
- Higher deductibles ($D_{RB} \approx 0.25L$)
- Actuarially fair + loading: $p^{RB}(a,w) = (1+\lambda) \cdot h(a,w) \cdot L$

**Natural Experiment:** Texas transitions; 18 control states retain flat-fee

## Theoretical Framework: The "Zombie Tank" Problem

\BerkeleyMode


<!-- wrete the utilites set up the idea as the thought experiment a single firm, with the same revenue ...
Under an optimal stoppin gmodel where they are tradin goff contiutaion vs close how does diffent liabilty contracts change their decisonis?
wirte the decion rule simply
wirte general ultliy funtion then putt like some simple note aobut how we parmeterized the simple exmpale for the following graphs. note we ried to not have edge cases  and note not real data  -->
**Firm's Dynamic Problem:**

Each period, facility chooses: $d_t \in \{\text{Maintain}, \text{Close}\}$

**Trade-off:**

- **Maintain:** Earn operating profit $\pi(x_t)$, face leak risk $h(a_t, w_t)$
- **Close:** Receive scrap value $\kappa$, exit market

**State Space:** $x = (A, w, \rho)$ where:

- $A \in \{1,...,9\}$: Age bin (5-year intervals)
- $w \in \{\text{single}, \text{double}\}$: Wall type
- $\rho \in \{FF, RB\}$: Insurance regime

## What about the pollution externality?

Insittiohllnly note clear how this will work.
LUSTs are discoved in two ways

- A) Major accidents ( car crashes into tank, natural disaster, driver drives away from dispenser etc)
- B) routine inspections, LEak deteciton monitoerionte etc
- C) Tank Closure Processes 

Texas could have more LUSTS because the private market incentives both A and B to discover more leaks relative to flat fee control markets.  

Inturen, in total texas could have copositianlly less leak risk because more tanks are closed earlier.



## From Theory to Empirics

\BerkeleyMode

**Testable Hypotheses from Toy Model:**

\vspace{0.3cm}

**H0 (Age Profile):** Risk-based pricing skews age distribution
$$f_{RB}(A) < f_{FF}(A) \quad \text{for high-risk } A$$

**H1 (Closure Hazard):** Risk-based pricing increases closure hazard
$$h^{close}_{RB}(x) > h^{close}_{FF}(x) \quad \text{for high-risk } x$$

**H2 (Selection):** High-risk types exit earlier under $RB$
$$\mathbb{E}[a | \text{exit}, RB] < \mathbb{E}[a | \text{exit}, FF]$$

**H3 (Environment):** Aggregate leak rates decline
$$\mathbb{E}[\lambda | RB] < \mathbb{E}[\lambda | FF]$$

## Empirical Strategy: Data & Sample

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Universe:** EPA National UST Database + State Administrative Records

**Sample Construction:**

| Filter | N Facilities | N Facility-Months |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Raw Texas + 18 Controls | 297,533 | ~60M |
| Active 1990–2023 | 185,000 | ~45M |
| **Incumbent Filter** (Pre-1999) | 72,000 | ~25M |

\vspace{0.3cm}

::: {.callout-warning}
**Critical:** DiD requires facilities active pre-1999 (no post-reform entrants)
:::

## Identification Strategy

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Difference-in-Differences Specification:**

$$
Y_{it} = \beta \cdot (\text{Texas}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \alpha_i + \delta_t + X'_{it}\gamma + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

where:

- $Y_{it} \in \{\text{LUST}, \text{Exit}, \text{Retrofit}\}$
- $\alpha_i$: Facility fixed effects
- $\delta_t$: Year-month fixed effects
- $X_{it}$: Age bins, wall type, motor fuel indicator

**Clustering:** State level (19 clusters); Webb WCB inference

**Key Insight:** Conditional on closure, Texas facilities chose **Replacement** over **Exit**

## Reduced Form Summary

\BerkeleyLightMode

**DiD Findings:**

| Outcome | Treatment Effect | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| LUST Detection | +1.2 pp | More leaks discovered |
| Annual Closure | +2.3 pp | Accelerated exit |
| Retrofit Rate | +1.8 pp | Technology upgrading |

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Transition to Structural:**

Reduced form identifies the **effect**, but we need a model for:

- **Welfare:** Is $W_{RB} > W_{FF}$?
- **Counterfactuals:** What if subsidies? Mandates?

## Dynamic Model Setup (Model B)

\BerkeleyMode

**Binary Optimal Stopping Problem:**

$$
V(x) = \max\left\{ \underbrace{u^m(x) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(x') | x, d=m]}_{\text{Maintain}}, \quad \underbrace{\kappa}_{\text{Close}} \right\} + \sigma\varepsilon
$$

**Flow Utility (Maintain):**

$$
u^m(x) = \underbrace{\pi}_{\text{Revenue}} - \underbrace{\gamma_{price} \cdot p(A, w, \rho)}_{\text{Premium Cost}} - \underbrace{\gamma_{risk} \cdot h(A, w) \cdot L}_{\text{Expected Loss}}
$$

**Parameters to Estimate:** $\theta = (\kappa, \gamma_{price}, \gamma_{risk})$

## Identification of Parameters

\BerkeleyMode

**Parameter Recovery via NPL:**

| Parameter | Identified By | Variation Source |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| $\kappa$ (Scrap Value) | Closure hazard *levels* | Cross-sectional exit rates |
| $\gamma_{price}$ (Price Sensitivity) | Response to premium schedule | Age × Wall × Regime gradient |
| $\gamma_{risk}$ (Risk Internalization) | Response to leak cost exposure | Deductible variation |

\vspace{0.3cm}

**Estimation:** Nested Pseudo-Likelihood (NPL) with K=2 iterations

**Standard Errors:** Bootstrap (B=999) to account for policy function estimation

---

## Estimation Results

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Model B Parameter Estimates:**

| Parameter | Estimate | SE | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|-----|----------------|
| $\hat{\kappa}$ | 6.25 | (0.84) | Scrap value (annual revenue units) |
| $\hat{\gamma}_{price}$ | −1.20 | (0.31) | Firms dislike premiums |
| $\hat{\gamma}_{risk}$ | 1.00 | (0.22) | Near-perfect private internalization |

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Interpretation:**

- $\gamma_{price} < 0$: Higher premiums $\Rightarrow$ higher closure probability
- $\gamma_{risk} \approx 1$: Firms fully internalize *private* leak costs
- Gap between private and social optimum $\Rightarrow$ externality not internalized

## Counterfactual Design

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Four Policy Scenarios:**

| # | Scenario | Implementation |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Baseline** | Status quo (TX: RB, Controls: FF) |
| 2 | **Social Optimum** | $\gamma_{risk} \times 2$ (internalize externality) |
| 3 | **Closure Subsidy** | $\kappa + \text{Subsidy}$ (pay to close) |
| 4 | **Mandate** | Force closure if $A \geq 30$ & Single-Walled |

\vspace{0.3cm}

**Welfare Metrics:**

- Average closure probability
- Expected leak risk: $\mathbb{E}[h(x) \cdot P(\text{maintain}|x)]$
- Social loss: Private loss $\times$ externality multiplier

## Counterfactual Comparison

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Welfare Summary:**

| Scenario | Avg Close Rate | $\Delta$ vs Baseline | Leak Risk | $\Delta$ Risk |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Baseline | 4.2% | — | 1.8% | — |
| Social Opt | 8.1% | +3.9 pp | 0.9% | −50% |
| Subsidy | 6.5% | +2.3 pp | 1.2% | −33% |
| Mandate | 5.8% | +1.6 pp | 1.4% | −22% |

\vspace{0.3cm}

**Ranking:** Social Optimum $>$ Subsidy $>$ Mandate $>$ Baseline

## Conclusion & Policy Implications

\BerkeleyMode

**Findings:**

1. **Risk-based pricing works:** +2–3 pp closure rates (DiD)
2. **Mechanism is upgrading, not abandonment:** Retrofit substitution
3. **Welfare-improving but not First Best:** Gap to Social Optimum remains

**Policy Recommendations:**

- Risk-based insurance dominates flat-fee pooling
- Targeted **closure subsidies** for high-risk tanks can close remaining welfare gap
- **Mandates** are less efficient (distort margins not requiring intervention)

**Broader Implication:** Market-based environmental regulation can outperform command-and-control when behavioral elasticities are sufficient.
