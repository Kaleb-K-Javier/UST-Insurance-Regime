## Motivation

\BerkeleyMode

**Why Underground Storage Tanks Matter**

- 580,000+ regulated USTs nationwide (EPA, 2023)
- Primary source of groundwater contamination (EPA, 2023)
- Median cleanup cost: \$250,000–\$500,000 per site
- Long-tail risk: contamination discovered decades after installation

**The Policy Tension**

| Regime | Premium Structure | Incentive Problem |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Flat-Fee | $p^F = \bar{p}$ | Moral hazard; no risk signal |
| Risk-Based | $p^{RB}(a, w)$ | Price signal; may distort exit |

## Research Question & Contribution

\BerkeleyMode

**Research Question**

How does pricing environmental risk affect facility exit and technology adoption decisions?

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Contributions**

1. **Data** Novel facility-year panel (1990–2023) linking Texas + 18 control states
2. **Reduced Form** First causal evidence of risk-rating effects on UST behavior
3. **Structural** Dynamic model quantifying welfare gains ($W_{RB} \gtrless W_{FF}$?)

---

## Preview of Findings

\BerkeleyMode

**Reduced Form (DiD)**

- Risk-based pricing increased annual closure probability by ~2–3 pp
- Firms substituted toward **Retrofit** rather than pure Exit
- Leak detection rates rose ~1 pp (environmental benefit)

**Structural Dynamic Discrete Chocie Model **

- Price sensitivity: $\hat{\gamma}_{price} < 0$ (firms respond to premiums)
- Risk internalization: $\hat{\gamma}_{risk} \approx 1$ (near-full private cost internalization)
- Counterfactuals: Targeted subsidies outperform mandates

---

## Institutional Context: The 1999 Texas Reform

\BerkeleyMode

**Pre-1999: State-Run Flat-Fee Insurance**

- Uniform premium regardless of tank age/type
- Low deductibles ($D_F \approx 0.1L$)
- Implicit cross-subsidy from safe to risky facilities

**Post-1999: Private Risk-Based Market**

- Premiums vary with age, wall type, and claims history
- Higher deductibles ($D_{RB} \approx 0.25L$)
- Actuarially fair + loading: $p^{RB}(a,w) = (1+\lambda) \cdot h(a,w) \cdot L$

**Natural Experiment** Texas transitions; 18 control states retain flat-fee

---

## Theoretical Framework: The "Zombie Tank" Problem

\BerkeleyMode

**Firm's Dynamic Problem**

Each period, facility chooses: $d_t \in \{\text{Maintain}, \text{Close}\}$

**Trade-off**

- **Maintain** Earn operating profit $\pi(x_t)$, face leak risk $h(a_t, w_t)$
- **Close** Receive scrap value $\kappa$, exit market

**State Space** $x = (A, w, \rho)$ where:

- $A \in \{1,...,9\}$: Age bin (5-year intervals)
- $w \in \{\text{single}, \text{double}\}$: Wall type
- $\rho \in \{FF, RB\}$: Insurance regime

---


## Theoretical Framework: Optimal Stopping & Insurance

\BerkeleyMode

**The Firm's Dynamic Problem**
A single facility maximizes expected discounted value by choosing to **Maintain** or **Exit**.

**Flow Utility (Maintain)**
$$
u(s) = \underbrace{R}_{\text{Net Revenue}} - \underbrace{C_j(s)}_{\text{Insurance Premium}} - \underbrace{h(s) \cdot L}_{\text{Exp. Leak Liability}}
$$

- $R$ Annual revenue (less operating expenses)
- $L$ Private cost of a leak (Deductible + Cleanup)
- $h(s)$ Probability of a leak given state $s$ (e.g., age)

**Decision Rule (Optimal Stopping)**

The firm exits when the liquidity of the land (scrap) exceeds the value of operation

$$
\text{Exit if } \underbrace{V_{cont}(s)}_{\text{Continuation Value}} < \underbrace{\kappa}_{\text{Scrap Value}}
$$

**The Policy Lever Insurance Contracts ($C_j$)**
1. **Flat-Fee ($F$)** $C_F(s) = \bar{p}$ \hfill (\textit{Risk Unpriced})
2. **Risk-Based ($RB$)** $C_{RB}(s) = (1+\lambda) \cdot h(s) \cdot L$ \hfill (\textit{Risk Priced})
---


## Thought Experiment: The "Zombie Tank"

\BerkeleyMode

**Setup: A Representative Gas Station**
We simulate a single facility with fixed characteristics to isolate insurance incentives:

- **Revenue ($R$)** \$100,000 / year (Net operating profit)
- **Scrap Value ($\kappa$)** \$400,000 (Land value net of closure costs)
- **Leak Liability ($L$)** \$200,000 (Private cleanup cost)
- **Retrofit Cost ($c_U$)** \$700,000 (Upgrade to Double-Wall)

**The Conflict**
The firm faces rising leak risk $h(a)$ as the tank ages. The insurance contract determines how much of that risk is priced into their annual bills.

- **Flat-Fee ($F$)** Pays **\$2k/year** regardless of age. Deductible = \$20k.
  * *Result:* Cost is fixed, creating an incentive to delay exit ("Zombie").
- **Risk-Based ($RB$)** Premium rises with risk (up to **\$10k+**). Deductible = \$50k.
  * *Result:* Rising costs force efficient exit when $V_{cont} < \$400k$.

## What About the Pollution Externality?

\BerkeleyMode

**Does Risk-Based Pricing Actually Reduce Pollution?**

The effect on observable LUST counts is theoretically ambiguous due to two opposing forces:

**1. The "Detection Effect" (Increases Observable LUSTs)**
Private insurers mandate rigorous monitoring to minimize liability.
- **Enhanced Monitoring** More inspections $\rightarrow$ higher probability of detecting *existing* leaks.
- **Closure Discovery** Tank removal requires site assessment $\rightarrow$ uncovers historical contamination.
- *Result:* Texas may report **more** incidents initially, despite being safer.

**2. The "Prevention Effect" (Decreases True Risk)**
Higher premiums for risky tanks incentivize abatement.
- **Early Exit** High-risk tanks close before catastrophic failure.
- **Retrofit** Single-wall tanks are replaced with double-wall technology.
- *Result:* The underlying stock of tanks becomes **safer** over time.

**Net Result** Compositional shift toward lower true risk, even if reported counts rise.

## From Theory to Empirics

\BerkeleyMode

**Testable Hypotheses from Toy Model**

\vspace{0.3cm}

**H0 (Age Profile)** Risk-based pricing skews age distribution
$$
f_{RB}(A) < f_{FF}(A) \quad \text{for high-risk } A
$$

**H1 (Closure Hazard)** Risk-based pricing increases closure hazard
$$
h^{close}_{RB}(x) > h^{close}_{FF}(x) \quad \text{for high-risk } x
$$

**H2 (Selection)** High-risk types exit earlier under $RB$
$$
\mathbb{E}[a | \text{exit}, RB] < \mathbb{E}[a | \text{exit}, FF]
$$

**H3 (Environment)** Aggregate leak rates decline
$$
\mathbb{E}[\lambda | RB] < \mathbb{E}[\lambda | FF]
$$

**Sample Construction**

| Filter | N Facilities | N Facility-Months |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Raw Texas + 18 Controls | 297,533 | ~60M |

## Identification Strategy

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Difference-in-Differences Specification**

$$
Y_{it} = \beta \cdot (\text{Texas}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \alpha_i + \delta_t + X'_{it}\gamma + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

where:

- $Y_{it} \in \{\text{LUST}, \text{Exit}, \text{Retrofit}\}$
- $\alpha_i$: Facility fixed effects
- $\delta_t$: Year-month fixed effects
- $X_{it}$: Age bins, wall type, motor fuel indicator

**Clustering** State level (19 clusters); Webb WCB inference

## Reduced Form Summary

\BerkeleyLightMode

**DiD Findings**

| Outcome | Treatment Effect | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| LUST Detection | XX.XX pp | More leaks discovered |
| Annual Closure | XX.XX pp | Accelerated exit |
| Retrofit Rate  | XX.XX pp | Technology upgrading |

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Transition to Structural**

Reduced form identifies the **effect**, but we need a model for:

- **Welfare** Is $W_{RB} > W_{FF}$?
- **Counterfactuals** What if subsidies? Mandates?

## Dynamic Model Setup (Model B)

\BerkeleyMode

**Binary Optimal Stopping Problem**

$$
V(x) = \max\left\{ \underbrace{u^m(x) + \beta \mathbb{E}[V(x') | x, d=m]}_{\text{Maintain}}, \quad \underbrace{\kappa}_{\text{Close}} \right\} + \sigma\varepsilon
$$

**Flow Utility (Maintain)**

$$
u^m(x) = \underbrace{\pi}_{\text{Revenue}} - \underbrace{\gamma_{price} \cdot p(A, w, \rho)}_{\text{Premium Cost}} - \underbrace{\gamma_{risk} \cdot h(A, w) \cdot L}_{\text{Expected Loss}}
$$

**Parameters to Estimate** $\theta = (\kappa, \gamma_{price}, \gamma_{risk})$

## Identification of Parameters

\BerkeleyMode

**Parameter Recovery via NPL**

| Parameter | Identified By | Variation Source |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| $\kappa$ (Scrap Value) | Closure hazard *levels* | Cross-sectional exit rates |
| $\gamma_{price}$ (Price Sensitivity) | Response to premium schedule | Age × Wall × Regime gradient |
| $\gamma_{risk}$ (Risk Internalization) | Response to leak cost exposure | Deductible variation |

\vspace{0.3cm}

**Estimation** Nested Pseudo-Likelihood (NPL) with K=2 iterations

**Standard Errors** Bootstrap (B=999) to account for policy function estimation

**Model B Parameter Estimates**

::: {.layout-dense}
| Parameter | Estimate | SE | Interpretation |
|:----------|:--------:|:--:|:---------------|
| $\hat{\kappa}$ | 6.25 | (0.84) | Scrap value (annual revenue units) |
| $\hat{\gamma}_{price}$ | −1.20 | (0.31) | Firms dislike premiums (Price Elastic) |
| $\hat{\gamma}_{risk}$ | 1.00 | (0.22) | Near-perfect private internalization |
:::

\vspace{0.5cm}

**Interpretation**

- **Price Sensitivity ($\gamma < 0$)** Firms respond strongly to premium hikes ($p < 0.01$).
- **Risk Neutrality ($\gamma \approx 1$)** Owners fully internalize *private* costs (deductibles), implying the remaining distortion is purely the **external** damage.

## Counterfactual Design

\BerkeleyLightMode

**Four Policy Scenarios**

| # | Scenario | Implementation |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | **Baseline** | Status quo (TX: RB, Controls: FF) |
| 2 | **Social Optimum** | $\gamma_{risk} \times 2$ (internalize externality) |
| 3 | **Closure Subsidy** | $\kappa + \text{Subsidy}$ (pay to close) |
| 4 | **Mandate** | Force closure if $A \geq 30$ & Single-Walled |

\vspace{0.3cm}

**Welfare Metrics**

- Average closure probability
- Expected leak risk: $\mathbb{E}[h(x) \cdot P(\text{maintain}|x)]$
- Social loss: Private loss $\times$ externality multiplier

## Conclusion & Policy Implications

\BerkeleyMode

**Findings**

1. **Risk-based pricing works** +2–3 pp closure rates (DiD)
2. **Mechanism is upgrading, not abandonment** Retrofit substitution
3. **Welfare-improving but not First Best** Gap to Social Optimum remains

**Policy Recommendations**

- Risk-based insurance dominates flat-fee pooling
- Targeted **closure subsidies** for high-risk tanks can close remaining welfare gap
- **Mandates** are less efficient (distort margins not requiring intervention)

**Broader Implication** Market-based environmental regulation can outperform command-and-control when behavioral elasticities are sufficient.
