# Motivation & Environmental Context
## Environmental Risk

Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) are the leading source of groundwater contamination in the US (EPA, UST facts 2024). 

  - Approximately 500,000 facilities nationwide storing hazardous motor fuels
  - Significant threat to drinking water supplies and public health (Marcus, 2021)

## Research Gaps

  - **No causal evidence:** No rigorous facility-level analyses of how federally mandated insurance affects pollution outcomes

  - **Limited empirical evidence:** Few studies test theoretical predictions about liability insurance as an environmental policy tool (Shavell, 2007)

  **I leverage Texas's 1999 transition from uniform-pricing to risk-based pricing market as a natural experiment to identify how insurance pricing structure affects environmental outcomes through facility owners' investment decisions.**





# Research Questions & Theoretical Predictions

**Core Mechanism:** Risk-based pricing directly connects premiums to expected damage costs, internalizing pollution externalities that flat-fee systems allow firms to ignore

**Theory predicts transition to risk-based insurance pricing can improve welfare. This work tests the necessary conditions and their implications:**

1. **Can observable characteristics create effective risk-differentiated contracts?**
   - Efficient risk-based pricing requires observable tank characteristics to be strong predictors of leak risk

2. **Do firms respond strategically to risk-based price signals?**
   - For welfare improvements, it is *necessary* for firms' behavior to be responsive to the prices/contracts they face

3. **Do these behavioral responses translate into environmental benefits?**
   - If firms respond to incentives by removing or upgrading risky tanks, pollution


# Data & Empirical Strategy

## Data: Universe of Underground Storage Tanks (1970-2020)

- Panel dataset of 309,640 facilities across 19 states ( Texas (treated): 64,090 facilities, Control states: 245,550 facilities)
- Primary analysis dataset: 143,647 single-walled facilities (pre-1999) $\rightarrow$ Highest risk facilities types

##  Empirical Strategy: Difference-in-Differences

**Identification Strategy**: Difference-in-differences comparing Texas facilities (treated) to facilities in EPA UST Trust Fund states (control) following Texas's 1999 policy change

$$\text{Y}_{i,t} = \beta \cdot (\text{Texas}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \gamma \cdot \text{Controls}_{i,t} + \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \epsilon_{i,t}$$

- Outcomes: Facility closure, tank replacement, market exit, leaks
- Fixed effects: Facility ($\alpha_i$) and year ($\alpha_t$)



# Headline Results: Risk Predictability & Firm Response

**1. UST Leak Risk is Predictable** \hyperlink{leak-risk}{\beamerbutton{Risk Graph}}

- Single-walled tanks have higher risk than double-walled tanks
- Risk increases substantially with tank age
- Oldest single-walled tanks show 7-8% annual leak probability

**2. Firm Response to Risk-Based Pricing** \hyperlink{hte-event_study_closure}{\beamerbutton{Event Study}}

- **Tank Closures** ↑ 1.8 percentage points (p < 0.01) \hyperlink{hte-closure}{\beamerbutton{By Age}}
- **Conditional on Closure:**
  - **Replacement:** ↑ 10.3 percentage points (p < 0.05)
  - **Exit:** ↓ 11.0 percentage points (p < 0.01) \hyperlink{hte-change-nature}{\beamerbutton{Exit vs Replace}}



# Headline Results: Environmental Outcomes
**Impact on Reported Leaks:**

- Overall leak probability ↓ 1.24 percentage points (p < 0.01) \hyperlink{hte-event_study_leak}{\beamerbutton{Event Study}}
- Represents ~30% reduction relative to mean leak probability

#  Next Steps and Ongoing Work

1. **Rust Style Structural Model of Retrofit/Closure Behavior**
  - Quantifying welfare loss of uniform insurance and decompose the effects into discrete behavioral responses
  - Welfare impacts of fully internalizing externality through insurance pricing
  - Comparing non-price interventions (e.g., mandates and subsidies) to risk-based insurance

2. **Econometric Extensions**
  - Replicate the OLS results using hazard models 

3. **Heterogeneity Analysis**
  - Effects by facility size, ownership structure, and geography
  - Selection effects of financial responsibility mechanisms
  - Distributional impacts across different facility types
