Formallize this notion:

Welfare depens on how sensative firms are to insuance premiums and risk exposure
-- Two margins---
+intensive behabior
+extensiv behavior
Both have their own elasticity both need to be measured.

The inefficnecy in a mandated flat premium world is corss-subsidation and no-price responseinve. WIth knowiong how sensative firms are we can quanityf the cross subsidataion??

Need to be clear on data side and there by the analsyis
