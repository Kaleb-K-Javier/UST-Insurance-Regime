## RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY SHIFT

### Version 1 Philosophy:
*"Document the 1998 upgrade mandate and major state variations"*

### Version 2 Philosophy (Per Supervisor):
*"Understand the FULL state of regulation and rules for USTs across the nation over time. Document the complete regulatory landscape evolution from 1988 to present."*

**This means:**
- Not just 1998, but the entire timeline
- Not just upgrades, but ALL regulatory mechanisms
- Not just technical requirements, but financial/administrative too
- Not just state-level, but geographic variations within states
- Not just what existed, but when it came into effect

3. Upgrade Mandate - 2015 Federal Update (operator training, inspections)
4. Operator Training Requirement (Class A/B/C specifics)
5. Inspection Requirement (3-year nSPECT)
6. Financial Assurance (fund details, eligibility)
7. Geographic Restriction - Wellhead Protection (if applicable)
8. [Any other state-specific requirements found]
```

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE RA

### Your Job Got Bigger BUT More Focused:

**BIGGER because:**
- More regulation categories to search for
- More states to document (add national inventory)
- Deeper documentation (financial assurance, geographic restrictions)
- Temporal dimension (when things took effect)

**MORE FOCUSED because:**
- Clear guidance on what to include (YES to everything)
- Clear process for historical access issues (document current + note caveat)
- Clear categories and search terms provided
- Template and examples provided

**Bottom Line:**
You're building a comprehensive regulatory database, not just documenting one deadline. This is important work that will support academic research on how environmental regulation evolved over three decades.
