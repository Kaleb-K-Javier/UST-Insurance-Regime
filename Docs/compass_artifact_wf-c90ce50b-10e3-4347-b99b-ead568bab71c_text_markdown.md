# California underground storage tank regulations: A comprehensive regulatory database

California operates one of the nation's most stringent UST regulatory programs—yet uniquely lacks EPA State Program Approval. The **December 31, 2025 single-walled tank closure deadline** represents the major "forced removal" mandate currently affecting approximately 50,000 legacy tanks statewide. The **RUST Program** (Replacing, Removing, or Upgrading Underground Storage Tanks) provides the lending/grant mechanism to incentivize compliance, distributing $183.1 million since 2015. California's program predates federal UST regulation by four years, establishing the nation's first comprehensive UST statutes in 1983 with enforcement beginning January 1, 1984.

## EPA state program approval status: California stands apart

California has **never received formal State Program Approval** from EPA under 40 CFR Part 281—a fact with significant regulatory implications. Of EPA Region 9's six states/territories, only Nevada and Hawaii hold approved programs. As of February 2026, 39 states plus DC and Puerto Rico have EPA-approved programs; California is notably absent from 40 CFR Part 282, which codifies approved state programs.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **EPA Approval Status** | NOT APPROVED |
| **Federal Register Citation** | None exists |
| **40 CFR 282 Section** | None designated for California |
| **Regulatory Consequence** | Both federal (40 CFR Part 280) AND state (CCR Title 23) regulations apply simultaneously |
| **Verification Confidence** | HIGH |

This dual-regulation status means California UST owners must comply with **both** federal requirements (40 CFR Part 280) and California's more stringent state requirements (CCR Title 23, Division 3, Chapter 16). The State Water Board has not announced any intent to seek EPA approval. In October 2018, California amended its regulations to "reconcile" with federal requirements while maintaining stricter groundwater protection standards.

## Implementing agency structure and jurisdiction

The California UST program operates through a tiered regulatory structure with state oversight and local implementation.

**State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB)** serves as the primary state regulatory authority under Health & Safety Code §25283 and §25299.3. SWRCB administers four program elements: (1) Leak Prevention Program—construction, monitoring, and testing standards; (2) Office of Tank Tester Licensing—licenses all tank integrity testers statewide; (3) UST Cleanup Program—oversees petroleum release remediation under the Low Threat Closure Policy; and (4) Enforcement coordination supporting local agencies. SWRCB also administers the UST Cleanup Fund and maintains the GeoTracker database for electronic reporting.

**Regional Water Quality Control Boards** (nine regions statewide) partner with Local Oversight Programs to oversee UST leak case cleanup. They serve as lead oversight agency when local capacity is inadequate, issue cleanup and abatement orders, and may take corrective action with cost recovery for non-compliant parties.

**Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPAs)** represent the primary local implementation layer. California currently maintains **81 CUPAs** and **24 Participating Agencies** certified by CalEPA under SB 1082 (1993). These local agencies—typically county environmental health departments or fire departments—issue operating permits, conduct mandatory annual inspections, oversee tank installations and closures, and exercise red tag authority for significant violations.

## Primary legal authority and regulatory citations

California's UST regulatory framework rests on two primary legal foundations with extensive implementing regulations.

### California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.7 (Sections 25280-25299.8)

| Section | Subject | Key Requirements |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **§25280** | Legislative findings | Program purpose: preventing contamination from underground storage |
| **§25281** | Definitions | Defines "underground storage tank," "CUPA," "primary/secondary containment," "unauthorized release" |
| **§25284** | Permits | Operating permit required from local agency; operation prohibited without valid permit |
| **§25284.1** | Leak prevention | Board authority for prevention regulations; training standards; secondary containment testing |
| **§25285** | Permit term | Permits effective up to 5 years; no permit if tank non-compliant |
| **§25288** | Annual inspections | Local agency must inspect every UST system **at least once annually** |
| **§25290.1** | Design/construction (post-July 2004) | Primary/secondary containment, continuous monitoring, spill/overfill protection |
| **§25291** | Design/construction requirements | Double-walled construction, monitoring systems, corrosion protection standards |
| **§25292.05** | **Single-walled closure deadline** | **Permanent closure required by December 31, 2025** |
| **§25292.2** | Financial responsibility | Owners must maintain evidence of financial responsibility |
| **§25292.3** | Red tag provisions | Delivery prohibition authority for non-compliant tanks |
| **§25298** | Tank closure | Procedures for abandonment, closure, or temporary cessation |
| **§25299** | Violations/penalties | Civil: $500-$5,000/day; criminal penalties for willful violations |

### California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Division 3, Chapter 16

This regulation—most recently amended effective January 1, 2026—provides detailed implementing requirements across twelve articles covering definitions (Article 1), general provisions (Article 2), construction requirements (Article 3), monitoring requirements (Article 4), reporting (Article 5), repair and upgrade (Article 6), closure (Article 7), release reporting (Article 8), tank tester licensing (Article 9), operator requirements (Article 10), corrective action (Article 11), and electronic laboratory data submission (Article 12).

## Federal baseline compliance: 1998 deadline implementation

California preceded federal UST regulation, with state requirements effective January 1, 1984—four years before federal regulations took effect in December 1988. For the December 22, 1998 federal upgrade deadline requiring spill prevention, overfill prevention, corrosion protection, and leak detection, California already had equivalent or more stringent requirements in place.

| Requirement | Federal Effective Date | California Effective Date |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| UST regulatory program | December 22, 1988 | January 1, 1984 |
| Upgrade deadline | December 22, 1998 | Pre-existing requirements |
| Secondary containment (new tanks) | October 13, 2015 | 1984 (single-wall ban) |
| Operator training | October 13, 2018 | January 1, 2005 |
| Walkthrough inspections | October 13, 2018 | October 1, 2018 |

### Red tag delivery prohibition provisions

California's red tag program (H&SC §25292.3; CCR Title 23, §§2717-2717.7) was approved by OAL on May 13, 2004. Three categories of **"significant violations"** trigger red tags: (1) violations causing or threatening environmental release; (2) violations impairing leak detection systems; and (3) chronic violations by recalcitrant violators. For imminent threats, red tags may be affixed immediately upon discovery. For non-imminent violations, owners receive written notice and **7 business days** to correct before red-tagging. Red-tagged systems cannot receive fuel deliveries or dispense fuel until violations are corrected and verified by local agency inspection within 5 days.

## 2015 federal update adoption: SB 445 and reconciliation

California adopted 2015 federal UST requirements through regulatory amendments effective **October 1, 2018**, following Board action on June 5, 2018. However, Senate Bill 445 (2014) represented California's more significant legislative action during this period.

### SB 445 (Stats. 2014, Ch. 547)

Signed September 25, 2014 as an urgency measure with immediate effect, SB 445 established five critical provisions:

- **Single-walled UST closure deadline**: Requires permanent closure of all single-walled USTs by **December 31, 2025** (H&SC §25292.05)
- **UST Cleanup Fund extension**: Extended sunset date (later extended again to January 1, 2036 by AB 1115)
- **Fee increase**: Raised storage fee from $0.014 to **$0.02 per gallon** on petroleum stored in USTs
- **Claim limits**: Reduced maximum Fund payment from $1.5 million to **$1 million** for post-2014 claims
- **Enforcement authority**: Board may require earlier closure if UST poses high threat to water quality

California's designated operator training requirements under CCR §2715 predated federal requirements by over 13 years, effective January 1, 2005. California uses "Designated UST Operator" certification rather than federal Class A/B/C designations, requiring ICC "California UST System Operator" certificates renewed every 24 months.

## 2025/2026 forced closure mandate: Single-walled tank deadline

The **December 31, 2025 deadline** for permanent closure of all single-walled underground storage tanks represents California's primary forced removal mandate—the specific lead mentioned in the research request.

| Field | Information |
|-------|-------------|
| **Regulation Type** | Mandatory permanent closure |
| **Affected Tanks Criteria** | All single-walled USTs and piping lacking secondary containment AND continuous leak detection |
| **Effective Compliance Date** | 2025-12-31 |
| **Enforcement Begins** | 2026-01-01 |
| **Primary Legal Citation** | Health & Safety Code §25292.05 |
| **Legislative Source** | Senate Bill 445 (Stats. 2014, Ch. 547) |
| **Implementing Regulations** | CCR Title 23, Division 3, Chapter 16, §2672 |
| **Non-Compliance Consequences** | Red-tagging (delivery prohibition); civil penalties $500-$5,000/tank/day |
| **Verification Confidence** | HIGH |

**Critical note**: H&SC §25292.05 explicitly states **"there are no exemptions, variances, or extensions"** to this deadline. Assembly Bill 626 (2025), which would have provided case-by-case grace periods, failed in Assembly Appropriations Committee on May 23, 2025.

### Compliance statistics (January 2026)

Approximately **50,000 single-walled USTs** existed in California before the 1984 prohibition on new single-walled installations. By the January 14, 2026 SWRCB press release, **99% compliance** had been achieved with over 49,350 tanks closed. Approximately **650 tanks at 279 facilities** remained non-compliant and subject to enforcement. About 60% of non-compliant facilities are in disadvantaged or severely disadvantaged communities, and 31 facilities are within 1,000 feet of drinking water wells.

### Age-based versus construction-based requirements

California's mandate is **construction-based, not age-based**. No explicit 30-year or similar age-based closure requirement exists. The law incorporates installation date criteria only as a construction proxy: tanks installed before January 1, 1984 that don't meet H&SC §25291(a)(1)-(6) requirements, and tanks designed per §25291(a)(7) installed before January 1, 1997 that don't meet those same standards.

## California requirements exceeding federal baseline

California exceeds federal minimum UST requirements in several significant areas:

**Secondary containment timing**: California prohibited single-walled tank installations in 1984—over three decades before the 2015 federal secondary containment requirements for new tanks took effect.

**Inspection frequency**: California requires **annual inspections** (H&SC §25288(a)) compared to the federal minimum of every three years under the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

**Single-walled tank phase-out**: No federal deadline exists for closing single-walled tanks; California's December 31, 2025 deadline is a state-specific requirement.

**Electronic reporting**: AB 2286 (2013) requires all regulated businesses to submit hazardous materials information electronically through the California Environmental Reporting System (CERS)—no equivalent federal mandate exists.

**Tank tester licensing**: California licenses tank testers through SWRCB's Office of Tank Tester Licensing under H&SC §25284.4 and CCR Title 23, Chapter 17.

**Operator training**: California's designated operator training requirements preceded federal requirements by 13+ years.

## Financial assurance and incentive programs

California maintains a comprehensive multi-tiered financial framework for UST compliance and cleanup—the lending/grant program referenced in the research request.

### Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Fund (USTCF)

The **Barry Keene Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Fund**, established February 1991 and EPA-approved as a federal financial responsibility mechanism June 9, 1993, has reimbursed over **$5 billion** for approximately 3,800 claims since inception.

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Administering Agency** | SWRCB, Division of Financial Assistance |
| **Funding Source** | $0.02/gallon storage fee (~$337 million annually) |
| **Maximum Claim (post-12/31/2014)** | $1,000,000 |
| **Maximum Claim (pre-12/31/2014)** | $1,500,000 |
| **Claim Application Deadline** | December 31, 2034 |
| **Fund Sunset Date** | January 1, 2036 |
| **Legal Authority** | H&SC Chapter 6.75; SB 299 (1989), SB 445 (2014), AB 1115 (2023) |

Priority classifications determine deductibles: Class A (residential) receives $0 deductible; Class B covers small businesses with ≤100 employees and ≤$15 million average gross receipts.

### RUST Program (lending/grant program for tank removals)

The **RUST Program** (Replacing, Removing, or Upgrading Underground Storage Tanks) is the specific lending/grant program incentivizing tank removals referenced in the research request.

**RUST Grants**:
- **Amount**: $3,000-$70,000 per grant; **$70,000 lifetime maximum** per business
- **Remote fueling station bonus**: Additional $140,000 above maximum for removing/replacing single-walled USTs
- **Eligibility**: Independently owned small business with <20 employees, principal office in California, selling <1.5 million gallons gasoline annually
- **Eligible costs**: Removing/replacing single-walled USTs with double-walled; upgrades (containment sumps, under-dispenser containment, electronic monitoring); enhanced leak detection

**RUST Loans**:
- **Amount**: $10,000-$750,000
- **Interest rate**: One-half of California's most recent general obligation bond rate
- **Terms**: 10-year or 20-year options
- **Eligibility**: Independently owned small business with <500 employees

**Program impact**: Since 2015, RUST has distributed **$183.1 million** to approximately 630 operators.

### Additional financial programs

The **Orphan Site Cleanup Fund (OSCF)** provides grants up to $1,000,000 for sites with no financially responsible party. The **Expedited Claim Account Program (ECAP)** has processed 326 claims totaling $84 million as of July 2024. The **Emergency, Abandoned and Recalcitrant (EAR) Account** funds immediate action for emergency, abandoned, or non-cooperative responsible party sites.

## Registration, permitting, and penalty structure

### Registration and permitting requirements

All UST owners/operators must obtain a **Permit to Operate** from their local CUPA, valid for 24 months to 5 years depending on jurisdiction. Electronic reporting through CERS is mandatory under AB 2286. Required documentation includes: Certification of Financial Responsibility, UST Monitoring Plan, UST Response Plan, Statement of Understanding and Compliance Form (submitted within 30 days of installation or ownership change), and Designated UST Operator Identification Form.

### Penalty structure (H&SC §25299)

| Violation Type | Penalty Range | Legal Citation |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Operating without permit/permit violations | $500-$5,000 per tank per day | §25299(a)(b) |
| Corrective action violations | Up to $10,000 per tank per day | §25299(d) |
| Red tag violations | Up to $5,000 per tank per day | §25299(e) |
| Criminal (falsifying records, failing to report) | $5,000-$10,000 AND/OR 1 year imprisonment | §25299(f) |

Penalty assessment factors include: extent of harm or potential harm, nature and duration of violation, frequency of past violations, and corrective action taken.

## Conclusion: Regulatory framework summary for database construction

California's UST regulatory framework presents a unique case study for environmental insurance and policy research. The state operates without EPA State Program Approval, creating dual federal-state compliance requirements. The **December 31, 2025 single-walled tank deadline** (SB 445) represents the primary forced removal mechanism, achieving 99% compliance while approximately 650 tanks at 279 facilities face ongoing enforcement.

The financial architecture—combining the $5+ billion USTCF with RUST's targeted grants and loans—demonstrates how state-administered environmental insurance mechanisms can substitute for private markets while creating compliance incentives. The program's upcoming transitions (USTCF financial responsibility mechanism ending January 1, 2035; Fund sunset January 1, 2036) present additional policy research opportunities regarding market transition dynamics.

California's approach of exceeding federal standards—particularly the 1984 single-walled prohibition, annual inspections, and mandatory electronic reporting—provides a natural experiment for comparing regulatory stringency effects across state boundaries. The absence of age-based closure requirements, with construction-based standards instead, offers contrast with jurisdictions using tank age as a regulatory trigger.
