# Texas Underground Storage Tank Regulations: Comprehensive Academic Database

Texas's UST regulatory framework underwent a pivotal transformation on **December 22, 1998**, when the state ended reliance on its public Petroleum Storage Tank Remediation Fund as acceptable federal financial assurance, forcing tank owners to obtain private insurance. This transition, coupled with the federal upgrade deadline on the same date, represents a natural experiment in risk-based insurance markets that replaced flat-fee public coverage. The EPA granted Texas state program approval effective **April 17, 1995** (60 FR 14372-14373), and TCEQ administers the program under Texas Water Code Chapter 26, Subchapter I and 30 TAC Chapter 334.

## EPA state program approval established Texas authority

Texas received EPA approval for its Underground Storage Tank program under 40 CFR Part 281, authorizing it to administer state regulations "in lieu of the Federal program."

## The 1999 financial assurance transition ended public insurance reliance

This section addresses the core dissertation research question regarding Texas's transition from flat-fee public insurance to risk-based private insurance.

### Petroleum Storage Tank Remediation Fund (PSTRF)

**Established:** 1989 by House Bill 1588 (71st Texas Legislature)
**Legal Authority:** Texas Water Code §§ 26.3572-26.3574; 30 TAC Chapter 334, Subchapter H
**Reimbursement Program Expiration:** 2012-09-01

### Critical transition date: December 22, 1998

**The pivotal finding for dissertation research**: As of December 22, 1998, tank owners could **NO LONGER** rely on the PSTR Fund account as proof of federally mandated financial assurance. Texas Water Code § 26.352 mandates that after this date, registration certificates are **NOT acceptable evidence** of financial responsibility for corrective action expenses on releases initially discovered and reported after December 22, 1998.

**Consequence:** Tank owners must acquire cleanup insurance from **private insurance providers** to meet federal requirements.

### Coverage amounts required (30 TAC § 37.815)

| Facility Type | Per-Occurrence Coverage | Annual Aggregate |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Petroleum marketers OR tanks handling >10,000 gal/month | $1,000,000 | — |
| All other petroleum UST owners/operators | $500,000 | — |
| Owners of 1-100 USTs within U.S. | — | $1,000,000 |
| Owners of 101+ USTs within U.S. | — | $2,000,000 |

### Petroleum product delivery fee structure (Texas Water Code § 26.3574)

| Cargo Tank Capacity | Fee Per Delivery |
|---------------------|------------------|
| < 2,500 gallons | Up to $3.75 |
| 2,500 - 4,999 gallons | Up to $7.50 |
| 5,000 - 7,999 gallons | Up to $11.75 |
| 8,000 - 9,999 gallons | Up to $15.00 |
| ≥ 10,000 gallons | Up to $18.75 |

**Historical note:** In 1995, fees were DOUBLED to repay general revenue fund obligations when the account became insolvent.

### 1999 legislative changes (76th Legislature)

Key legislation (HBs 2109, 2815, 2816) implemented the transition framework:

1. **Limited administrative expenses** to specifically appropriated amounts
2. **Decreased delivery fee by 25%** on bulk motor fuel loads
3. **Provided termination date** of September 1, 2003 (later extended)
4. **Suspended fee collection** after $100 million unobligated balance cap reached (February 2000)
5. **Reinstated fee trigger** when unobligated balance falls to $25 million

### Eligibility requirements for fund participation

- Tank registered by **December 31, 1995**
- All facility fees paid in full (annual fees, late fees, penalties, interest)
- Compliance with technical standards (30 TAC §§ 334.49, 334.50, 334.51)
- Financial assurance records maintained per 30 TAC Chapter 37, Subchapter I
- Self-certification compliance

### Acceptable private financial assurance mechanisms (30 TAC Chapter 37, Subchapter I)

1. Insurance/Pollution Legal Liability (most common)
2. Surety bond
3. Letter of credit
4. Financial test (self-insurance)
5. Corporate guarantee
6. Trust fund
7. Local government financial test (§ 37.371)
8. Local government guarantee (§ 37.381)

**CRITICAL:** Mechanisms must be worded **EXACTLY** per 30 TAC Chapter 37, Subchapter I. Federal 40 CFR 280 wording is NOT acceptable (except for local government mechanisms). ACORD forms are also unacceptable.

### Transition timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1987-09-01 | Original PST program established (SB 779) |
| 1989 | PSTR Fund created (HB 1588) |

| 1995-12-31 | Registration deadline for fund eligibility |
| **1998-12-22** | **STATE FUND NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE AS FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSURANCE** |
| 1999 | 76th Legislature passes transition legislation |
| 2000-02 | Fee suspended after $100M cap reached |
| 2012-09-01 | Reimbursement program expired |

**Regulation Entry:**
- Type: Financial Assurance Transition (Public to Private Insurance)
- Affected Tanks: All petroleum UST facilities requiring federal financial responsibility demonstration
- Effective Compliance Date: 1998-12-22

## Conclusion: Key insights for dissertation research

The Texas UST regulatory framework offers a compelling case study for analyzing insurance market transitions. The **December 22, 1998 date** represents the critical inflection point when Texas simultaneously enforced federal upgrade deadlines and ended state fund reliance for financial assurance. This created a natural experiment where tank owners faced both compliance costs and mandatory private insurance procurement.

**Three features distinguish Texas's approach:**
- **Early secondary containment mandate** (2009) preceded federal requirements by seven years, demonstrating regulatory leadership
- **Edwards Aquifer protections** (1977) established environmental safeguards 12 years before federal rules existed
- **Green Tag delivery certification** uses positive confirmation rather than prohibition tags, placing compliance burden on facility operators rather than distributors

The 1995 fund insolvency (requiring doubled fees) and subsequent 1999 legislative reforms suggest the public insurance model faced sustainability challenges. The transition to risk-based private insurance likely introduced price signals that were absent under flat-fee public coverage, potentially affecting tank owner compliance decisions—a hypothesis suitable for econometric analysis using tank closure and upgrade data around the transition period.

**Research limitations:** No academic papers specifically analyzing Texas's UST insurance transition were identified. Historical premium comparison data between state fund fees and private insurance costs would strengthen economic analysis. The Texas Department of Insurance archives and TCEQ historical records division may contain relevant documentation from the 1998-1999 transition period.
