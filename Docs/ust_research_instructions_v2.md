# Research Assistant Instructions: UST Regulation Research Enhancement
## Version 2.0 - Comprehensive State Command-and-Control Regulations

---

## OBJECTIVE

Expand and verify the UST regulation research to create a comprehensive database of ALL command-and-control regulations that states imposed beyond the federal EPA baseline. Transform the existing single-deadline table into a detailed state-regulation observation dataset.

---

## CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED (Must Complete First)

### 1. TEXAS - COMPLETE THE RESEARCH
**Status:** Currently incomplete but included in analysis
**Required Actions:**
- Determine Texas EPA State Program Approval status (check 40 CFR Part 282)
- Identify implementing agency (likely TCEQ)
- Find primary statute (likely Texas Water Code)
- Find administrative code (likely 30 TAC Chapter 334)
- Verify December 22, 1998 deadline adoption
- Document any Texas-specific requirements beyond EPA baseline

### 2. TEMPORAL ACCURACY - VERIFY 1998 REGULATIONS
**Problem:** Current research cites regulations from 2004-2024, not what existed in 1998
**Required Actions:**

For EACH state-specific requirement (beyond federal baseline), answer: **"When did this regulation become effective?"**

**How to verify:**
1. Access archived state administrative codes from 1998-1999 period
   - Contact state law libraries
   - Use Internet Archive for state websites
   - Request historical code books from state agencies

2. Identify which requirements were added AFTER 1998
   - The 2015 federal UST update (operator training, walkthrough inspections, secondary containment for NEW tanks) should be documented with effective dates
   - Distinguish between 1998 requirements and post-1998 amendments
   - Document effective date for each requirement

3. For each state-specific requirement, document:
   - Effective date of the requirement
   - Whether it existed in 1998 or was added later

**SUPERVISOR GUIDANCE ON HISTORICAL ACCESS:**
- If you CANNOT access the historical 1998 version of a regulation after reasonable effort:
  - Document the CURRENT regulation
  - Add note: "Current regulation accessed [DATE] - historical 1998 version not available"
  - Mark as "Requires Historical Verification" in Verification Status column
  - Supervisor will locate historical records if needed
- This is acceptable for initial submission
- Focus your time on finding NEW regulations rather than getting stuck on historical versions

**Priority states to verify:**
- Oklahoma (OAC 165:25 shows 2004-2008 amendments)
- Massachusetts (310 CMR 80.00 effective 2015)
- New Mexico (20.5 NMAC - verify 1998 version)

### 3. VERIFY FEDERAL REGISTER CITATIONS
**Problem:** Some citations incomplete or not independently verified

**Required Actions:**
- Access actual Federal Register documents for each EPA approval date
- Verify page numbers for incomplete citations:
  - Kansas: 59 FR ___ (1994) → Find page numbers
  - Pennsylvania: 68 FR ___ (September 11, 2003) → Find page numbers
- Confirm all dates match official Federal Register notices
- Document access date and method (FederalRegister.gov, HeinOnline, etc.)

### 4. VERIFY STATE-SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL DEADLINES
**High Priority - These are important for research design**

Must verify with PRIMARY SOURCES (statutes or administrative code):

| State | Claim to Verify | Citation to Check | Action |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Massachusetts | Single-wall steel tanks removed by Aug 7, 2017 | 310 CMR 80.15 | Access MA regulations, confirm exact language |
| Maine | Pre-1985 tanks close by Jan 1, 2008 | 38 M.R.S.A. § 564(5) | Access ME statutes, confirm exact language |
| Kentucky | Lined-only tanks add CP by Dec 22, 2013 | 401 KAR 42:030 Section 12(1) | Access KY regulations, confirm exact language |
| Kentucky | Unprotected steel close by Jan 1, 2012 | 401 KAR 42:030 Section 5(2) | Access KY regulations, confirm exact language |

## NEW RESEARCH SCOPE - COMMAND AND CONTROL REGULATIONS

You did excellent work identifying the 1998 baseline deadline. Now we need to expand to capture ALL state-imposed command-and-control regulations beyond EPA requirements.

### Types of Regulations to Identify

**IMPORTANT:** Based on supervisor guidance, we are documenting the **FULL regulatory landscape** including:
- ✅ 1998 baseline requirements
- ✅ 2015 federal update requirements (operator training, inspections)
- ✅ State-specific enhancements beyond federal baseline
- ✅ Geographic restrictions and special area requirements
- ✅ Financial assurance and fund requirements

#### Category 1: FORCED REMOVAL/CLOSURE MANDATES
**What to look for:** Deadlines that FORCE tank closure/removal based on age or construction type

**Examples you've already found:**
- Massachusetts: Single-wall steel tanks removed by Aug 7, 2017
- Maine: Pre-1985 tanks close by Jan 1, 2008  
- Kentucky: Lined-only tanks add CP or close by Dec 22, 2013
- Kentucky: Unprotected steel close by Jan 1, 2012

**What else to search for:**
- California (you mentioned CA but didn't include in current research - FIND THIS)
- Any state with age-based closure mandates (e.g., "all tanks >30 years old")
- Any state with material-based bans (e.g., "bare steel banned after [date]")
- Any state with location-based requirements (e.g., near schools, water sources)

**Search terms:**
- "[State] underground storage tank phase out"
- "[State] UST removal deadline"
- "[State] UST age limit"
- "[State] single wall tank prohibition"

#### Category 2: DOUBLE-WALL/SECONDARY CONTAINMENT MANDATES
**What to look for:** Requirements that NEW installations must be double-walled

**Examples you've already found:**
- New Mexico: Secondary containment required after April 4, 2008
- Oklahoma: Double-walled tanks required after July 1, 2008
- North Dakota: Secondary containment required after January 1, 2009

**What else to search for:**
- Effective dates for EACH state
- Whether requirement applies to:
  - All new tanks?
  - Only tanks in sensitive areas?
  - Only certain capacities?
- Specific construction standards required

**Search terms:**
- "[State] UST secondary containment requirement"
- "[State] double wall tank requirement"
- "[State] new UST installation standards"

#### Category 3: ENHANCED SPILL/OVERFILL REQUIREMENTS
**Examples you've found:**
- Oklahoma: Requires BOTH 90% alarm AND 95% shutoff (federal = either/or)
- New Mexico: Requires BOTH 90% alarm AND 95% shutoff

**What else to search for:**
- Do other states have this dual requirement?
- Do any states have even stricter requirements (e.g., 85% alarm)?
- Do any states ban specific equipment (e.g., Oklahoma's ball float valve ban)?

#### Category 4: RELEASE DETECTION RESTRICTIONS
**Example you've found:**
- Oklahoma: Prohibits vapor monitoring, groundwater monitoring, and SIR for product line detection

**What else to search for:**
- Do other states restrict which release detection methods are allowed?
- Do any states require MORE STRINGENT release detection (e.g., continuous ATG vs. periodic)?

#### Category 5: OPERATOR TRAINING/CERTIFICATION
**What to look for:** State-specific training beyond federal requirements (**INCLUDE 2015 FEDERAL BASELINE**)

**Federal 2015 Baseline (document for each state):**
- Class A operators (manager - overall responsibility)
- Class B operators (daily on-site operations)
- Class C operators (daily on-site monitoring)
- Training frequency requirements
- Retraining requirements

**State enhancements to look for:**
- Mandatory certification programs beyond federal training
- State-administered exams or licensing
- More frequent training requirements
- Additional operator classes or specializations
- Specific training content requirements

**Note:** Federal operator training became required in 2015, but many states had earlier or more stringent requirements. Document both the federal baseline adoption date AND any state-specific enhancements.

**Search terms:**
- "[State] UST operator training"
- "[State] UST operator certification"
- "[State] Class A B C operator"
- "[State] UST training requirements"

#### Category 6: INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS
**What to look for:**
- Mandatory third-party inspections (like Massachusetts' 3-year nSPECT)
- State inspection programs
- Compliance inspection frequency

#### Category 7: FINANCIAL ASSURANCE/INSURANCE
**What to look for:** Financial responsibility requirements (**SUPERVISOR PRIORITY - FR RULES ARE IMPORTANT**)

**Federal Baseline:**
- $1 million per occurrence for petroleum USTs
- $2 million annual aggregate

**State variations to document:**
- Required insurance amounts beyond federal minimum
- Mandatory state fund participation (and fund details)
- Financial assurance mechanisms (insurance, trust fund, surety bond, etc.)
- Fund coverage amounts (per occurrence, per site, annual limits)
- Fund eligibility requirements (compliance-based, fee-based)
- Deductibles or co-pays
- Exclusions from fund coverage

**Fund structure details to capture:**
- Fund name and statutory authority
- Funding source (per-tank fees, per-gallon fees, general revenue)
- Coverage amounts
- Reimbursement procedures
- Compliance requirements for eligibility

**Search terms:**
- "[State] UST trust fund"
- "[State] UST financial responsibility"
- "[State] UST insurance requirement"
- "[State] petroleum cleanup fund"
- "[State] LUST fund"

#### Category 8: REGISTRATION/PERMITTING FEES
**What to look for:**
- Annual per-tank fees
- Registration requirements
- Permit costs

**Note:** You have some of this data already (e.g., Kansas $20 registration + $25/tank, Ohio $100/tank)

#### Category 9: DELIVERY PROHIBITION MECHANISMS
**What to look for:**
- "Red tag" programs
- Delivery certificate requirements
- Penalties for delivering to non-compliant tanks

#### Category 10: GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS AND SPECIAL AREA REQUIREMENTS
**What to look for:** Regulations that apply based on tank location (**SUPERVISOR PRIORITY - INCLUDE THESE**)

**Types of geographic restrictions:**
- Proximity to public water supply wells
- Wellhead protection areas
- Proximity to schools, daycare facilities
- Proximity to surface water bodies (rivers, lakes, streams)
- Source water protection zones
- Aquifer recharge areas
- Environmentally sensitive areas

**What to document:**
- Distance requirements (e.g., "within 1,000 feet of...")
- Enhanced requirements in these zones (e.g., mandatory double-wall, more frequent inspections)
- Prohibitions (e.g., "no new UST installations within...")
- Special permitting requirements

**Search terms:**
- "[State] UST wellhead protection"
- "[State] UST source water protection"
- "[State] underground storage tank near schools"
- "[State] UST sensitive area requirements"
- "[State] UST aquifer protection"

#### Category 11: FEDERAL 2015 UPDATE REQUIREMENTS
**What to look for:** Requirements from the 2015 federal UST regulation update (**SUPERVISOR CONFIRMED - INCLUDE THESE**)

**Federal 2015 requirements to document:**
- Operator training (Class A, B, C requirements)
- Walkthrough inspections (frequency and scope)
- Secondary containment for new/replaced tanks (after October 13, 2015)
- Secondary containment for new/replaced piping (after October 13, 2015)
- Periodic testing of spill prevention equipment
- Periodic testing of overfill prevention equipment
- Periodic testing of release detection equipment

**For each state, document:**
- Date state adopted 2015 federal requirements
- Whether state had MORE STRINGENT requirements before 2015
- State-specific variations or enhancements
- Operator training program details (state-run vs. third-party)

**Note:** Even though these are post-1998, supervisor wants them documented to show the **full evolution of the regulatory landscape over time**.

**Search terms:**
- "[State] UST operator training requirement"
- "[State] 2015 UST regulation adoption"
- "[State] UST walkthrough inspection"
- "[State] UST operator certification"

#### Category 12: OTHER INNOVATIVE REGULATIONS
**Be alert for unique state requirements such as:**
- Geographic restrictions (proximity to water sources, schools, etc.)
- Capacity limits in certain areas
- Product-specific requirements (E15, biodiesel compatibility)
- Compatibility requirements for alternative fuels
- Leak detection reporting frequency
- Tank testing/tightness testing requirements

## RESEARCH PROCESS INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Complete Critical Fixes (Priority Order)

1. **Texas full research** (1-2 days)
2. **Verify Massachusetts, Maine, Kentucky additional deadlines** (1 day)
3. **Verify Federal Register citations** (1 day)
4. **Temporal accuracy check for state-specific requirements** (2-3 days)

### Step 2: Systematic State-by-State Search

"[state name] 2015 UST regulation"
"[state name] UST walkthrough inspection"
"[state name] Class A B C operator"
"[state name] UST operator certification"
site:[state].gov operator training UST
```

#### Search Set F: Financial Assurance (NEW - FR RULES IMPORTANT)
```
"[state name] UST trust fund"
"[state name] petroleum cleanup fund"
"[state name] UST financial responsibility"
"[state name] LUST fund"
"[state name] UST insurance requirements"
site:[state].gov UST financial assurance
```

#### Search Set G: State Agency Resources
```
Direct searches on state agency websites:
- State DEQ/DEP UST program pages
- State fire marshal UST pages  
- Look for:
  * Fact sheets
  * Guidance documents
  * Regulatory summaries
  * Compliance timelines
  * FAQ pages
```

### Step 3: Documentation Requirements

For EACH regulation you identify:

1. **Primary source verification**
   - Access the actual statute or administrative code
   - Screenshot or save PDF of relevant section
   - Document access date
   - Note any amendments since 1998

2. **Record required information**
   - Who does it apply to? (affected tanks criteria)
   - When must they comply? (effective date)
   - What happens if they don't? (penalties/enforcement)
   - What's the legal citation?
   - When was this requirement established?

3. **Temporal verification**
   - Was this requirement in effect in 1998?
   - Or was it added later?
   - If added later, what year?

### Step 4: California Research (High Priority)

The supervisor mentioned California but it's not in your current research. **California likely has extensive UST regulations.**

Research priorities for California:
1. Determine EPA State Program Approval status
2. Identify all forced closure/removal mandates
3. Document secondary containment requirements
4. Find enhanced standards beyond federal baseline
5. Verify 1998 deadline adoption

### Step 5: Quality Control Checks

Before submitting final research:

☐ Every state has at least ONE row (the 1998 federal baseline)
☐ All "Requires Verification" items have been verified or clearly flagged
☐ All Federal Register citations include page numbers
☐ All state-specific requirements have effective dates documented
☐ Temporal accuracy verified (1998 vs. later requirements clearly distinguished)
☐ Texas fully researched
☐ California fully researched
☐ All citations include specific sections (not just chapter-level)
☐ Non-compliance results documented for each regulation
☐ Verification status accurately reflects confidence level

1. **Which states went beyond the federal 1998 baseline?** (Count regulations by state)

2. **What types of command-and-control regulations are most common?** (Count by regulation type)

3. **Are there regional patterns?** (Do neighboring states adopt similar requirements?)

4. **Timeline of requirements** (When did different types of regulations become effective?)

5. **How do states enforce compliance?** (Patterns in non-compliance results)

6. **Double-wall requirement adoption** (Which states required it, when?)

7. **Additional closure mandates** (Which states forced closure beyond 1998 deadline?)

## SUPERVISOR GUIDANCE - ANSWERS TO KEY QUESTIONS

The following clarifications have been provided by the supervisor:

### 1. Include 2015 Federal Update Regulations?
**ANSWER: YES** - Include operator training, walkthrough inspections, and other 2015 federal requirements even though they're post-1998. Document when each requirement became effective.

### 2. Expand Beyond Current 20 States?
**ANSWER: NOT FOR NOW** - Focus on completing the current 20 states (19 + Texas). However, CREATE A REFERENCE TABLE showing which other states exist and note "Not Yet Researched" so we have a complete national inventory framework for future expansion.

### 3. Include Geographic Restrictions?
**ANSWER: YES** - Include regulations that apply only in specific geographic areas (e.g., near schools, water sources, wellhead protection zones). These are important command-and-control variations.

### 4. What If Can't Access Historical 1998 Regulations?
**ANSWER: YES, NOTE CURRENT REGULATIONS WITH CAVEATS** - If you cannot access the historical 1998 version of a regulation, document the current regulation and clearly note:
- "Current regulation accessed [DATE] - historical 1998 version not available"
- Supervisor will locate historical records if needed
- This is acceptable for initial submission

### 5. Include Financial Assurance Requirements?
**ANSWER: YES - COMPREHENSIVE SCOPE** - Include financial assurance requirements and fund details. The goal is to understand the **full state of regulation and rules for USTs across the nation over time**. Financial responsibility (FR) rules are important components of the regulatory framework.

## FINAL NOTE

This is high-quality, important work. The supervisor is using this for academic research, so accuracy and verifiability are critical. When in doubt:

1. **VERIFY rather than assume**
2. **Document your verification process**
3. **Flag items that need more research**
4. **Distinguish between what you've confirmed and what you've cited**

Your initial research was strong - this is about elevating it from good to publication-ready.
