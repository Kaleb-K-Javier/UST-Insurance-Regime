# PART I: FEDERAL FOUNDATION

## Executive Summary

This document provides a standardized framework for classifying underground storage tanks (USTs) based on their construction type across all U.S. jurisdictions. The classification system is built on federal EPA regulations and can be adapted to incorporate state-specific requirements.

### Classification Categories
1. **Single-Walled UST** - Primary containment only
2. **Secondary Contained UST** - Double-walled or with secondary barrier and interstitial monitoring
3. **Unknown** - Insufficient data for classification

### Regulatory Authority Hierarchy
```
Federal Baseline (EPA 40 CFR Part 280)
    ↓
State Regulations (Must be "no less stringent")
    ↓
Local/County Requirements (Additional restrictions permitted)
```

**Critical Principle:** State regulations must be **at least as stringent** as federal requirements but may impose more restrictive standards.

## Federal Regulatory Framework

### Governing Statutes

#### 1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) - Subtitle I
**Citation:** 42 U.S.C. § 6991 et seq.  
**Enacted:** November 8, 1984 (Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments)  
**Authority:** Grants EPA authority to regulate USTs containing petroleum or hazardous substances  
**URL:** https://www.epa.gov/rcra/resource-conservation-and-recovery-act-rcra-overview

**Key Provisions:**
- Section 9003 (42 U.S.C. § 6991b): Notification requirements
- Section 9004 (42 U.S.C. § 6991c): State program approval authority
- Section 9005 (42 U.S.C. § 6991d): EPA inspection and monitoring
- Section 9006 (42 U.S.C. § 6991e): Federal enforcement

#### 2. Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Section 1530
**Citation:** Public Law 109-58, 119 Stat. 1075  
**Enacted:** August 8, 2005  
**URL:** https://www.epa.gov/ust/secondary-containment-underground-storage-tank-systems-2005-energy-policy-act

**Key Requirements (Section 1530):**
Secondary containment requires that new or replaced tanks and piping within 1,000 feet of an existing community water system or an existing potable drinking water well must be secondarily contained (this includes interstitial monitoring).

States receiving federal UST funds must require EITHER:
- **Option A:** Secondary containment + under-dispenser containment for new/replaced systems within 1,000 feet of drinking water sources
- **Option B:** Enhanced financial responsibility + installer certification

**Implementation Note:** Most states chose Option A (secondary containment).

**2015 Revision Summary (80 FR 41566):**

This is the first major revision to the federal UST regulations since 1988. The 2015 UST regulation changed certain portions of the 1988 underground storage tank technical regulation in 40 CFR part 280.

Changes to the regulations include: Adding secondary containment requirements for new and replaced tanks and piping; adding operator training requirements; adding periodic operation and maintenance requirements for UST systems; addressing UST systems deferred in the 1988 UST regulation; adding new release prevention and detection technologies; updating codes of practice; making editorial corrections and technical amendments; and updating state program approval requirements to incorporate these new changes.

#### 40 CFR Part 281 - State Program Approval
**Original Promulgation:** September 23, 1988 (53 FR 37194)  
**Major Revision:** July 15, 2015 (80 FR 41566)  
**URL:** https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-I/part-281

**Key Requirements for State Program Approval:**
1. Program must be "no less stringent" than federal standards (40 CFR § 281.30)
2. Must regulate at least the same USTs as federal program (40 CFR § 281.31)
3. Must have adequate authority for compliance monitoring and enforcement (40 CFR § 281.32)
4. Must maintain and make available records and reports (40 CFR § 281.36)

Under the 2015 state program approval (SPA) regulation, the 38 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which currently have SPA, must reapply by October 13, 2018 in order to retain their SPA status.

**State Program Approval Status:**
- As of January 2026, 52 states and territories have updated their regulations to incorporate the 2015 federal requirements
- States WITH SPA: Owners/operators follow state requirements
- States WITHOUT SPA: Owners/operators must comply with both federal AND state requirements

## Universal Classification Categories

### Definition Framework

#### Category 1: Single-Walled UST
**Definition:** An underground storage tank with only primary containment and no secondary barrier for leak detection and containment.

**Characteristics:**
- Single structural barrier between stored product and environment
- May have corrosion protection (cathodic protection, internal lining, coatings)
- May have leak detection equipment (monitoring wells, ATG, etc.)
- Corrosion protection ≠ Secondary containment

**Federal Recognition:** 40 CFR § 280.20(a) recognizes single-walled tanks installed before December 22, 1988 if properly upgraded with corrosion protection and leak detection.

#### Category 2: Secondary Contained UST
**Definition:** Secondary containment means the tank and piping have an inner and outer barrier with an interstitial space that is monitored for leaks and includes containment sumps when those sumps are used for interstitial monitoring of the piping.

**Required Components (per 40 CFR § 280.20(d)):**
1. **Dual Barriers:** Inner (primary) and outer (secondary) containment
2. **Interstitial Space:** Monitored area between the two barriers
3. **Leak Detection:** Continuous or periodic monitoring of interstitial space
4. **Liquid Tightness:** Both barriers must prevent product escape

**Acceptable Secondary Containment Methods:**
- **Double-walled tanks:** Factory-manufactured tank within a tank
- **Jacketed tanks:** Outer jacket surrounding primary tank
- **Composite construction:** Steel inner tank with fiberglass outer shell
- **Excavation zone liner:** Synthetic or concrete liner surrounding tank (must meet specific criteria)

**Federal Requirement Triggers:**
1. All new UST tanks and piping installed after April 11, 2016 (40 CFR § 280.20(d))
2. Replacement of existing tank (removal of tank and installation of another)
3. Replacement of 50% or more of any piping run connected to a tank

#### Category 3: Unknown
**Definition:** Classification cannot be determined from available data.

**Common Reasons:**
- No material construction type (MCT) data available
- Conflicting indicators in data
- Pre-1990 fiberglass tanks without additional information
- Missing installation dates
- Data quality issues

### Detailed Federal Requirements

#### Pre-December 22, 1988 Installation

**Regulatory Status (40 CFR § 280.21):**
- Original installation did NOT require corrosion protection or release detection
- Must have been UPGRADED by December 22, 1998 with:
  - Corrosion protection (cathodic protection, internal lining, or non-corrodible material)
  - Release detection (monitoring, testing, or leak detection equipment)

**Classification Implication:**
- Vast majority are **single-walled** tanks that received upgrades
- Secondary containment was NOT required; upgrades added protection to single-walled systems
- If no upgrade documented → likely out of compliance or closed

#### December 22, 1988 - April 10, 2016 Installation

**Regulatory Status (40 CFR § 280.20(a-c)):**
- Required corrosion protection at installation
- Required release detection
- Secondary containment NOT federally required (except under Energy Policy Act conditions)

**Classification Implication:**
- Default assumption: **single-walled with corrosion protection**
- Exception: Some states required secondary containment earlier than federal requirement
- Check state-specific requirements for this period

#### Post-April 11, 2016 Installation or Replacement

**Regulatory Status (40 CFR § 280.20(d)):**

Beginning on April 11, 2016, owners and operators must install secondarily contained tanks and piping when installing or replacing tanks and piping. Owners and operators must use interstitial monitoring as release detection for these new or replaced tanks and piping.

**"Replaced" Definitions:**
- **Tank:** Replaced for a tank means to remove a tank and install another tank
- **Piping:** Replaced for piping means to remove 50 percent or more of piping and install other piping

**Classification Implication:**
- All new tanks/piping: **Secondary Contained** (federal requirement)
- All replacement tanks/piping: **Secondary Contained** (federal requirement)
- Repairs not triggering replacement threshold: May remain single-walled

## Tank Construction Types & Materials

### Material Construction Type Classifications

Understanding the material construction is essential for classification. The following framework applies universally across all jurisdictions.

#### Steel Tank Constructions

##### Single-Walled Steel Indicators

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Federal Standard |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Bare steel (unprotected) | BARE_STEEL | Single-Walled | Non-compliant (unless pre-1988) |
| Steel with asphalt coating, no cathodic protection | STL_ASPH_NOCP | Single-Walled | Non-compliant (unless upgraded) |
| Steel with asphalt coating, without cathodic protection | STL_ASPH_WOCP | Single-Walled | Non-compliant (unless upgraded) |

##### Single-Walled Steel with Corrosion Protection

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Federal Standard |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Cathodically protected steel - impressed current | CP_STEEL_IC | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(2)) |
| Cathodically protected steel - sacrificial anode | CP_STEEL_SAC | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(2)) |
| Cathodically protected steel with internal lining | CP_STEEL_INT_LINE | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(3)) |
| Epoxy-coated steel | EPOXY_COAT_STL | Single-Walled | Compliant if properly installed |
| Internally lined steel tank | INT_LINED_STEEL | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(3)) |
| Asphalt-coated steel (general) | ASPH_STEEL | Single-Walled | Requires CP upgrade |

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Cathodic protection (CP) is an **upgrade method** per 40 CFR § 280.21. It provides corrosion protection to single-walled tanks but does NOT create secondary containment.

**Federal Definition (40 CFR § 280.12):**
> "Upgrade means the addition or retrofit of some systems such as cathodic protection, lining, or spill and overfill controls to improve the ability of an underground storage tank system to prevent the release of product."

##### Secondary Contained Steel

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Federal Standard |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Double-walled steel | DOUBLE_WALL_STL | Secondary Contained | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(d)) |
| Composite steel and fiberglass | COMP_STL_FBRGLS | Secondary Contained | Compliant if properly specified |

#### Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic (FRP) Constructions

**Manufacturing Standards:** UL 1316 - "Glass-Fiber-Reinforced Plastic Underground Storage Tanks for Petroleum Products, Alcohols, and Alcohol-Gasoline Mixtures"

**Federal Recognition:** 40 CFR § 280.20(b) - Tanks must be constructed of fiberglass-reinforced plastic in accordance with UL Standard 1316.

##### Single-Walled FRP

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Single-wall fiberglass | FRP_SINGLE | Single-Walled | Common in 1970s-1980s |
| Single-wall plastic | PLASTIC_SINGLE | Single-Walled | Less common for USTs |

##### Secondary Contained FRP

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Double-walled fiberglass | FRP_DOUBLE | Secondary Contained | Industry standard post-1990 |
| Fiberglass with jacket | FRP_JACKET | Secondary Contained | Factory-installed secondary barrier |

**Fiberglass Classification Logic:**
```
IF material = "Fiberglass" OR "FRP" OR "Plastic":
    IF install_date >= January 1, 1990:
        THEN Classification = "Secondary Contained" (medium-high confidence)
        REASON: Industry predominantly shifted to double-wall by 1990
    ELSE IF install_date < January 1, 1990:
        THEN Classification = "Unknown"
        REASON: Mix of single and double-wall during this period
    END IF
END IF
```

**Rationale:** While both single-wall and double-wall fiberglass tanks are UL-listed, the industry predominantly adopted double-wall construction by 1990 as best practice. States may have different cutoff dates based on their specific requirements.

#### Concrete and Field-Constructed Tanks

**Regulatory History:** Field-constructed tanks were **deferred** from the original 1988 regulations but were brought under regulation in the 2015 revision.

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Concrete single-wall | CONCRETE_SINGLE | Single-Walled | Rare; mostly historical |
| Concrete with liner | CONCRETE_LINER | Context-dependent | Depends on liner specifications |
| Field-constructed (any material) | FIELD_CONSTRUCT | Context-dependent | Now regulated under 40 CFR 280.251 |

**Field-Constructed Tank Requirements (40 CFR § 280.251):**
- Tanks installed after October 13, 2015: Must meet same standards as shop-fabricated tanks
- Tanks installed on/before October 13, 2015: Must have release detection by October 13, 2018

#### Excavation Zone Liners

**Definition:** A synthetic or concrete barrier placed in the excavation around a tank to provide secondary containment.

**Federal Requirements (40 CFR § 280.20):**
- Must surround tank on all sides
- Must be inspectable or testable
- May satisfy secondary containment if properly designed and monitored

**Classification:** If properly documented → **Secondary Contained**

### Tank Material Summary Table

| Material Category | Typical Era | Default Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Bare Steel | Pre-1988 | Single-Walled | Non-compliant unless upgraded |
| Steel + Asphalt | 1950s-1980s | Single-Walled | Common legacy tanks |
| Steel + CP | 1988-2016 | Single-Walled | Compliant single-wall |
| Steel + Internal Lining | 1988-2016 | Single-Walled | Compliant single-wall |
| Double-Wall Steel | Any | Secondary Contained | |
| Composite Steel/FRP | 1990s+ | Secondary Contained | |
| Single-Wall FRP | 1970s-1990s | Single-Walled | Less common after 1990 |
| Double-Wall FRP | 1990s+ | Secondary Contained | Industry standard |
| Concrete | Pre-1990 | Context-dependent | Rare for USTs |

## Secondary Containment: Federal Definition

### Regulatory Definition

**40 CFR § 280.12:**
> "Secondary containment or secondarily contained means a release prevention and release detection system for a tank or piping. This system has an inner and outer barrier with an interstitial space that is monitored for leaks. This term includes containment sumps when used for interstitial monitoring of piping."

### Required Components

#### 1. Dual Barrier System
- **Primary (Inner) Barrier:** Contains the regulated substance under normal operations
- **Secondary (Outer) Barrier:** Contains releases from the primary barrier and prevents soil/groundwater contamination

#### 2. Interstitial Space
- Physical space between inner and outer barriers
- Must allow for monitoring or inspection
- May contain monitoring fluid (colored glycol solution) or be dry with sensors

#### 3. Leak Detection/Monitoring
**40 CFR § 280.43(g) - Interstitial Monitoring:**
- Must be capable of detecting a release through the inner wall
- May use continuous electronic monitoring or periodic visual/manual inspection
- For double-walled systems, must monitor the space between the walls

**Methods:**
- Electronic sensors with alarms
- Hydrostatic monitoring (liquid-filled interstitial space)
- Vacuum monitoring (pressure decay testing)
- Visual inspection (for accessible secondary containment)

#### 4. Liquid-Tight Construction
- Both barriers must prevent product passage
- Penetrations (manholes, fill pipes, etc.) must maintain integrity
- Testing required: Per 40 CFR § 280.43(g), must test within 30 days of installation and every 3 years thereafter

### What DOES Qualify as Secondary Containment

| System Type | Description | Federal Citation |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Double-walled tank** | Factory-manufactured tank within a tank | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Jacketed tank** | Primary tank with outer jacket, monitored interstitial space | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Composite tank** | Inner steel tank, outer FRP shell with interstitial monitoring | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Tank with excavation zone liner** | Primary tank + synthetic liner surrounding excavation with monitoring | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Double-walled piping** | Pipe within a pipe with interstitial monitoring | 40 CFR 280.43(g) |
| **Piping in containment sump** | Single-wall pipe within monitored containment sump | 40 CFR 280.43(g) |

### What DOES NOT Qualify as Secondary Containment

| System Type | Reason | Federal Guidance |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| **Cathodic protection** | No secondary barrier; only corrosion prevention | Upgrade per 280.21, not secondary containment |
| **Internal tank lining** | No secondary barrier; only corrosion prevention | Upgrade per 280.21, not secondary containment |
| **Epoxy coatings** | No secondary barrier; only corrosion prevention | 40 CFR 280.20(a)(3) |
| **Monitoring wells** | Leak detection, not containment | 40 CFR 280.43 (release detection, not containment) |
| **Spill buckets** | Captures spills at fill pipe, not tank containment | 40 CFR 280.20(c)(1)(i) |
| **Overfill prevention** | Prevents overfills, not containment | 40 CFR 280.20(c)(1)(ii) |
| **Vapor monitoring** | Detects releases, doesn't contain them | 40 CFR 280.43(e) |
| **Groundwater monitoring** | Detects releases, doesn't contain them | 40 CFR 280.43(d) |

---

## Upgrades vs. Secondary Containment

### The Critical Distinction

**This is perhaps the most important concept in UST classification.**

#### Upgrades (40 CFR § 280.21)

**Definition:** "Upgrade means the addition or retrofit of some systems such as cathodic protection, lining, or spill and overfill controls to improve the ability of an underground storage tank system to prevent the release of product."

**Purpose:** Make existing single-walled tanks COMPLIANT with federal standards

**Historical Context:** 
- Original 1988 regulation required existing tanks to be upgraded by December 22, 1998
- Upgrades allow single-walled tanks to meet performance standards without replacement
- Upgraded tanks remain single-walled but are code-compliant

**Common Upgrade Methods:**

1. **Cathodic Protection (CP)**
   - **Method:** Impressed current or sacrificial anode system
   - **Purpose:** Prevents external corrosion of steel tanks
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.20(a)(2) & § 280.21(b)(1)
   - **Testing:** Must be tested every 3 years (40 CFR § 280.31)
   - **Classification Impact:** Tank remains **single-walled**

2. **Internal Lining**
   - **Method:** Epoxy or fiberglass coating applied to interior of steel tank
   - **Purpose:** Prevents internal corrosion from product
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.21(b)(2)
   - **Inspection:** Must be internally inspected every 10 years (40 CFR § 280.21(b)(2))
   - **Classification Impact:** Tank remains **single-walled**

3. **Combination: CP + Internal Lining**
   - **Method:** Both cathodic protection AND internal lining
   - **Purpose:** Prevents both internal and external corrosion
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.21(b)(3)
   - **Classification Impact:** Tank remains **single-walled**

4. **Spill/Overfill Prevention Equipment**
   - **Method:** Installation of catchment basins, automatic shutoff devices
   - **Purpose:** Prevents releases during filling operations
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.20(c)
   - **Classification Impact:** Does not affect tank wall classification

#### Secondary Containment (40 CFR § 280.20(d))

**Definition:** Dual-barrier system with interstitial monitoring

**Purpose:** CONTAIN and DETECT releases before environmental impact

**Implementation:** 
- Required for all new/replaced tanks and piping after April 11, 2016
- Cannot be retroactively added to existing single-walled tanks (would require tank replacement)
- Creates **secondary contained** classification

**Methods:**
- Double-walled tank installation
- Tank replacement with secondary contained unit
- Piping replacement (≥50%) with double-walled piping

### Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Upgrade (40 CFR 280.21) | Secondary Containment (40 CFR 280.20(d)) |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Make existing single-wall compliant | Provide dual-barrier protection |
| **Applied To** | Existing tanks in place | New or replacement tanks |
| **Tank Walls** | Single barrier | Double barrier (inner + outer) |
| **Release Prevention** | Corrosion protection | Physical containment |
| **Release Detection** | External methods (monitoring, testing) | Interstitial monitoring |
| **Cost** | Lower (retrofit) | Higher (new tank required) |
| **Federal Deadline** | December 22, 1998 (for existing tanks) | April 11, 2016 (for new/replaced tanks) |
| **Classification** | Single-Walled (upgraded) | Secondary Contained |

### Data Field Implications

Many UST databases contain fields for upgrade dates. Understanding what these mean:

| Field Name | Typical Meaning | Classification Impact |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `initial_cp_upgrade_date` | Date cathodic protection first installed | Indicates single-walled tank that received CP upgrade |
| `subsequent_cp_upgrade_date` | Date of CP system repairs/retesting | Ongoing maintenance of single-walled system |
| `internal_lining_date` | Date tank interior was lined | Indicates single-walled tank that received lining upgrade |
| `compliance_upgrade_date` | Date tank met 1998 deadline | Generic upgrade; likely remains single-walled |
| `replacement_date` | Date tank was replaced | If after April 11, 2016 → Secondary Contained |

**Key Takeaway:** Upgrade dates indicate the tank was and remains **single-walled** unless explicitly replaced with a secondary contained system.

## Universal Classification Algorithm

### Decision Tree Framework

This algorithm provides a universal approach to classifying USTs. State-specific adjustments are incorporated in Part II.

```
START CLASSIFICATION

1. CHECK INSTALLATION/REPLACEMENT DATE

   IF installation_date >= State Secondary Containment Requirement Date:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: State law requires secondary containment
      
   ELSE IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Federal secondary containment requirement (40 CFR 280.20(d))
      
   ELSE IF replacement_date >= April 11, 2016:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Federal secondary containment requirement for replacements

2. CHECK EXPLICIT DOUBLE-WALL INDICATORS

   ELSE IF double_walled = TRUE OR double_wall_flag = "Y":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Explicitly marked as double-walled construction
      
   ELSE IF composite_steel_fiberglass = TRUE:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Composite construction is inherently double-walled
      
   ELSE IF excavation_zone_liner = TRUE:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
      REASON: Liner provides secondary containment if properly monitored

3. CHECK FIBERGLASS/PLASTIC MATERIALS (DATE-DEPENDENT)

   ELSE IF (material = "Fiberglass" OR material = "FRP" OR material = "Plastic"):
      IF installation_date >= January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Industry standard post-1990 is double-wall FRP
      ELSE IF installation_date < January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: Mix of single and double-wall FRP before 1990
      END IF

4. CHECK SINGLE-WALL STEEL INDICATORS

   ELSE IF bare_steel = TRUE:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Unprotected bare steel (likely non-compliant unless pre-1988)
      
   ELSE IF asphalt_steel = TRUE AND cathodic_protection = NULL:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Asphalt-coated steel without CP upgrade
      
   ELSE IF asphalt_steel_without_cp = TRUE:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Explicitly marked without cathodic protection

5. CHECK UPGRADE INDICATORS (SINGLE-WALL WITH PROTECTION)

   ELSE IF initial_cp_upgrade_date IS NOT NULL:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Tank received CP upgrade; upgrades apply to single-walled tanks

### Confidence Scoring

Classification confidence should be tracked alongside the classification itself:

| Confidence Level | Criteria | Examples |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| **High** | Explicit data field or regulatory requirement | • `double_walled = TRUE`<br>• Install date after April 11, 2016<br>• `cp_upgrade_date` populated |
| **Medium-High** | Strong inference from data patterns | • Fiberglass tank installed 1995<br>• Composite construction<br>• State requirement met |
| **Medium** | Reasonable inference with some uncertainty | • Asphalt steel, no CP data<br>• Upgrade indicators present |
| **Low** | Weak inference or insufficient data | • Pre-1990 fiberglass<br>• Conflicting indicators<br>• Missing key fields |

# PART II: STATE-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION

## Louisiana Implementation

### Overview

Louisiana has implemented UST regulations that are **more stringent** than federal requirements, particularly regarding the secondary containment mandate date.

**Implementing Agency:** Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), Single Event Upset Section  
**State Program Approval Status:** Approved State Program (SPA)  
**Federal Register Approval:** June 4, 2020 (85 FR 34287)  
**URL:** https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/04/2020-09941/louisiana-final-approval-of-state-underground-storage-tank-program-revisions

### Louisiana Regulatory Framework

#### State Statutes
**Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 30 - Environmental Quality Act**
- La. R.S. 30:2001 et seq. - Underground Storage Tanks

#### State Regulations
**Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC) Title 33, Part XI - Underground Storage Tanks**
**URL:** https://www.doa.la.gov/media/dbzfugdz/33v11.pdf

**Key Sections:**
- **LAC 33:XI.101** - Applicability
- **LAC 33:XI.303** - Performance Standards for New UST Systems
- **LAC 33:XI.701** - General Requirements for Release Detection

### Louisiana-Specific Requirements

#### 1. Secondary Containment Requirement - EARLIER THAN FEDERAL

**LAC 33:XI.303.C.1:**
> "All UST systems installed after December 20, 2008, shall have secondary containment with interstitial monitoring for tanks and piping."

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Louisiana Requirement:** December 20, 2008
- **Federal Requirement:** April 11, 2016
- **Difference:** Louisiana mandate is **7 years, 4 months** earlier than federal

**Components Required (LAC 33:XI.303.C):**
1. **Tanks:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring
2. **Piping:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring
3. **Monitoring:** Monthly inspection of interstitial space
4. **Under-Dispenser Containment:** Required per LAC 33:XI.303.D.4
5. **Submersible Turbine Pump Containment:** Required under certain conditions (LAC 33:XI.303.D.5)

**URL:** https://deq.louisiana.gov/page/secondary-containment-or-financial-responsibilityinstaller-certification

#### 2. Piping Replacement Trigger - MORE STRINGENT

**LAC 33:XI.303.D.2.g:**
> "If twenty-five percent (25%) or more of a piping run is replaced or repaired, the entire piping run shall be made secondarily contained with interstitial monitoring."

**Comparison to Federal:**
- **Louisiana Trigger:** 25% of piping run
- **Federal Trigger:** 50% of piping run (40 CFR § 280.20(d))
- **Louisiana is MORE RESTRICTIVE**

#### 3. Under-Dispenser Containment

**LAC 33:XI.303.D.4:**
Required for all new dispenser systems installed after December 20, 2008 (earlier than federal requirement).

#### 4. Emergency Generator USTs

**LAC 33:XI.101.A.1.c:**
Effective August 9, 2009, emergency generator USTs must meet release detection requirements (removed from federal deferral earlier than EPA).

### Louisiana-Specific Timeline

### Louisiana-Specific Considerations

#### 1. Grant Program for Upgrades
Louisiana established a grant program (effective January 1, 2024) to help owners upgrade single-wall systems to double-wall.

**Source:** https://deq.louisiana.gov/page/underground-storage-tank

**Classification Impact:** Tanks upgraded through this program should have documentation showing:
- Original installation date (pre-2008)
- Upgrade/replacement date (post-2024)
- If replacement occurred → Classification changes to "Secondary Contained"

#### 2. Emergency Generator USTs
Louisiana removed the emergency generator deferral earlier than EPA (August 9, 2009 vs. October 13, 2018).

**Classification Impact:** Emergency generator tanks in Louisiana:
- Installed before August 9, 2009: May be single-walled but must have release detection
- Installed after August 9, 2009: Subject to same standards as other USTs

#### 3. Parish-Level Analysis
Louisiana uses "parishes" instead of "counties". When analyzing data:
- Use `parish_desc` field for geographic grouping
- Consider regional differences (e.g., coastal parishes may have more stringent requirements)
- Urban vs. rural parish differences in compliance patterns

#### 4. Hurricane Impacts
Louisiana USTs may have been affected by hurricanes. Check for:
- Gaps in inspection/testing dates
- Emergency replacements after major storms
- FEMA-funded replacement programs (likely resulted in secondary containment)

## Alabama Implementation

### Overview

Alabama has implemented UST regulations through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) that incorporate federal requirements and include specific state provisions for secondary containment and operational requirements.

**Implementing Agency:** Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), Water Division - Water Quality Program  
**State Program Approval Status:** Approved State Program (SPA)  
**Federal Register Approval:** September 14, 2021 (86 FR 51129)  
**Most Recent Regulation Revision:** December 15, 2024  
**URL:** https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/14/2021-19659/alabama-final-approval-of-state-underground-storage-tank-program-revisions

### Alabama Regulatory Framework

#### State Statutes
**Alabama Code Title 22, Chapter 36 - Underground Storage Tank and Wellhead Protection Act of 1988**
- Ala. Code § 22-36-1 et seq. - Underground Storage Tanks
- Enacted: 1988

#### State Regulations
**Alabama Administrative Code (ADEM Admin. Code r.) Chapter 335-6-15**  
**Full Citation:** Technical Standards, Corrective Action Requirements and Financial Responsibility for Owners and Operators of Underground Storage Tanks  
**Revised Effective:** December 15, 2024  
**URL:** https://adem.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Division6Volume2.pdf

**Key Sections:**
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.01** - Purpose
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.02** - Definitions
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06** - Performance Standards for New UST Systems and Dispensers
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.07** - Upgrading of Existing UST Systems
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.09** - Operation, Maintenance, and Testing of Spill and Overfill Prevention Equipment and Containment Systems
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.14** - General Release Detection Requirements for All UST Systems

### Alabama-Specific Requirements

#### 1. Secondary Containment for Dispensers and Sumps - EARLIER THAN FEDERAL

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.02(ss) - "New dispenser system" definition:**
> "New dispenser system is either a newly manufactured or operational dispenser and the equipment necessary to connect the dispenser to the underground storage tank system, which includes check valves, shear valves, unburied risers, flex connectors, or other transitional components which connect the dispenser to the underground piping, which is installed for the first time or at a new location on **August 6, 2007** and thereafter."

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06(g) - Performance Standards:**

New dispenser systems installed on or after **August 6, 2007** must have:
1. **Under-dispenser containment (UDC)** that is liquid-tight on sides and bottom, and capable of containing leaks from dispenser equipment
2. **Overfill prevention** for the under-dispenser containment sump
3. **Submersible turbine pump (STP) containment** when applicable

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Alabama Requirement (Dispensers/Sumps):** August 6, 2007
- **Federal Requirement (Full Secondary Containment):** April 11, 2016
- **Difference:** Alabama mandated under-dispenser and STP containment **8 years, 8 months** earlier than full federal secondary containment

**Note:** This requirement is specific to **dispenser system components**, not complete tank and piping secondary containment. Alabama follows the federal April 11, 2016 date for full secondary containment of tanks and piping.

#### 2. Containment Sump Requirements

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.02(m) - Containment sump definition:**

Alabama defines four types of containment sumps:
1. **UST top sump** (submersible turbine pump sump) - at top of tank
2. **Under-dispenser containment sump** - underneath dispenser
3. **Transition sump** - at piping transitions
4. **Intermediate sump** - at other points in piping run

All containment sumps must be:
- Liquid-tight
- Capable of protecting the environment by containing leaks and spills
- Single-walled or secondarily contained

#### 3. Piping Transition Containment - STATE-SPECIFIC

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06(h):**

All underground piping installed or replaced on or after **December 8, 2017** must have containment at transitions between:
- Double-walled piping and single-walled components
- Different piping materials
- Piping and equipment

This is a **state-specific requirement** not found in federal regulations.

#### 4. Operator Training Requirements

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.46 - Operator Training:**

Alabama requires three classes of operators:
- **Class A Operator:** Primary responsibility for operation and maintenance
- **Class B Operator:** Day-to-day implementation and recordkeeping
- **Class C Operator:** First line of response to emergencies

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Federal requirement: October 13, 2016
- Alabama incorporated this into state regulations per SPA

#### 5. Delivery Prohibition Authority

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.45 - Delivery Prohibition:**

Alabama has specific authority to prohibit delivery of regulated substances ("red tag") for:
1. **Significant noncompliance requiring delivery prohibition** - immediate prohibition
2. **Significant noncompliance subject to delivery prohibition** - prohibition after notice and time to comply

This enforcement mechanism is more explicitly defined than federal regulations.

### Alabama-Specific Timeline

| Date | Alabama Requirement | Citation | Federal Equivalent |
|------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **April 5, 1989** | Original Alabama UST regulations effective | ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15 | December 22, 1988 (federal effective date) |
| **August 6, 2007** | Under-dispenser containment and STP containment required for new dispenser systems | ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06(g) | Not required until April 11, 2016 (8.7 years later) |
| **April 11, 2016** | Secondary containment required for all new/replaced tanks and piping | ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06(a) | 40 CFR 280.20(d) (federal requirement) |
| **December 8, 2017** | Containment required at piping transitions | ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06(h) | No federal equivalent (state-specific) |
| **September 14, 2021** | Federal approval of Alabama's 2015 UST regulation revisions | 86 FR 51129 | State program re-approval |
| **December 15, 2024** | Most recent revision to Alabama UST regulations | ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15 | Updates to state regulations |

### Alabama Data Structure

Based on the Alabama ADEM database, the following field structure is observed:

#### Primary Classification Field
- **`tank_construction_material`** - Full description including wall type, material, and additional details
- **`tank_construction_material_select`** - Simplified material category

#### Material Categories in Alabama Data

**Frequency Distribution (N=52,570 total tanks):**

| Material Category | Count | Percentage |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Steel | 37,415 | 71.2% |
| Single Wall, Steel | 4,217 | 8.0% |
| Fiberglass reinforced plastic | 3,027 | 5.8% |
| Double Wall, Fiberglass reinforced plastic | 1,685 | 3.2% |
| Fiberglass coated steel | 1,650 | 3.1% |
| NA | 1,346 | 2.6% |
| Double Wall, Fiberglass coated steel | 1,262 | 2.4% |
| Fiberglass reinforced plastic, Single Wall | 1,061 | 2.0% |
| Fiberglass coated steel, Single Wall | 473 | 0.9% |
| Double Wall, Steel | 214 | 0.4% |
| All other categories | 220 | 0.4% |

**Key Observations:**
1. **"Steel" without qualifier:** 71.2% of tanks - requires installation date analysis
2. **Explicit "Single Wall" prefix:** 8.0% + 2.0% + 0.9% = 10.9% explicitly marked
3. **Explicit "Double Wall" prefix:** 3.2% + 2.4% + 0.4% = 6.0% explicitly marked
4. **"Fiberglass coated steel":** Composite construction (steel + fiberglass outer layer)
5. **Missing data (NA):** 2.6% of tanks

START ALABAMA CLASSIFICATION

1. FEDERAL SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DATE (Tanks and Piping)

   IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Very High Confidence)

      CITATION: 40 CFR 280.20(d)

2. EXPLICIT DOUBLE-WALL INDICATORS IN DATA

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Double Wall":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Explicitly marked as double-walled construction in Alabama database
      CITATION: Data field indicator
      
   ELSE IF tank_construction_material_select = "Double Wall":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Simplified field indicates double-wall
      CITATION: Data field indicator

3. COMPOSITE CONSTRUCTION (Fiberglass Coated Steel)

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Fiberglass coated steel" AND NOT "Single Wall":
      IF installation_date >= January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Modern fiberglass-coated steel is typically composite (steel inner, FRP outer)
      ELSE:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: Early fiberglass-coated steel may be single-wall with coating
      END IF

4. FIBERGLASS REINFORCED PLASTIC (DATE-DEPENDENT)

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Fiberglass reinforced plastic" AND NOT "Single Wall":
      IF installation_date >= January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Industry standard post-1990 is double-wall FRP
      ELSE IF installation_date < January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: Mix of single and double-wall FRP before 1990
      END IF

5. EXPLICIT SINGLE-WALL INDICATORS

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Single Wall":

      IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
         REASON: Post-federal requirement, all new steel tanks must be double-wall
      ELSE IF installation_date >= January 1, 2000:
         RETURN "Single-Walled" (Medium Confidence)
         REASON: Likely single-wall steel with CP; no state requirement for secondary containment
      ELSE IF installation_date < January 1, 2000:
         RETURN "Single-Walled" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Pre-2000 steel tanks are predominantly single-wall
      ELSE IF installation_date IS NULL:

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS ("GLASTEEL" OR "GLAS STEEL"):
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "TITAN":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium Confidence)
      REASON: Titan brand typically double-wall, but verify with install date

8. MISSING DATA

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material = "NA" OR tank_construction_material IS NULL:
      IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium Confidence)
         REASON: Federal requirement despite missing material data
      ELSE:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: No material information and no regulatory requirement to infer from date
      END IF

9. DEFAULT CASE

### Alabama-Specific Considerations

#### 1. High Proportion of Unqualified "Steel" Tanks

**Challenge:** 71.2% of Alabama tanks (37,415) are simply marked as "Steel" without "Single Wall" or "Double Wall" qualifier.

**Approach:**
- Use installation date as primary classification factor
- Pre-2000 steel tanks: Classify as "Single-Walled" (medium-high confidence)
- 2000-2016 steel tanks: Classify as "Single-Walled" (medium confidence) - no state secondary containment requirement
- Post-2016 steel tanks: Classify as "Secondary Contained" (high confidence) - federal requirement

**Validation Needed:** Sample inspection data or upgrade records could increase confidence for unqualified steel tanks.

#### 2. Fiberglass-Coated Steel Interpretation

**Alabama Pattern:** "Fiberglass coated steel" appears in 1,650 tanks plus variants.

**Industry Context:** 
- **Composite construction:** Steel inner tank with fiberglass outer shell = secondary containment
- **Single-wall coated:** Steel tank with fiberglass coating/lining = single-walled

**Alabama Classification Approach:**
- If marked "Fiberglass coated steel" WITHOUT "Single Wall" AND installed post-1990 → Classify as "Secondary Contained" (medium-high confidence)
- If marked "Fiberglass coated steel, Single Wall" → Classify as "Single-Walled" (high confidence)
- Pre-1990 without qualifier → Classify as "Unknown" (need additional information)

#### 3. Brand Name Recognition

Alabama data contains several brand names that indicate construction type:

| Brand Name | Typical Construction | Classification |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **ACT-100** | Double-wall composite steel/FRP | Secondary Contained |
| **GLASTEEL / Glas Steel** | Double-wall composite | Secondary Contained |
| **TITAN / Titan Poly** | Usually double-wall | Secondary Contained (verify with date) |
| **PERMATANK** | Double-wall | Secondary Contained |
| **ELUTRON** | Double-wall | Secondary Contained |
| **STI-P3** | Cathodically protected single-wall steel | Single-Walled |

#### 4. Under-Dispenser Containment Tracking

While not directly related to tank classification, Alabama's **August 6, 2007** under-dispenser containment requirement creates an additional data point:

- Facilities with new dispensers installed after this date should have UDC
- This can serve as a cross-validation point for facility upgrade history
- May indicate broader facility upgrades including tank replacement

#### 5. Missing Installation Dates

**Alabama Data Pattern:** Some tanks may have missing installation dates.

**Approach:**
- If material = "Double Wall" → Classify as "Secondary Contained" (high confidence) regardless of date
- If material = "Single Wall" → Classify as "Single-Walled" (high confidence) regardless of date
- If material = "Steel" or "Fiberglass" without qualifier and no date → Classify as "Unknown" (low confidence)

#### 6. Multi-Compartment Tanks

Alabama data shows compartment designations (e.g., "8P/4D" = 8,000 gallon premium / 4,000 gallon diesel).

**Note:** Compartments within a single tank share the same construction type. The classification applies to the entire tank structure, not individual compartments.

#### 7. Geographic Considerations

**Alabama-Specific Factors:**
- **Coastal counties** (Mobile, Baldwin): May have more stringent local requirements or faster adoption of secondary containment due to environmental sensitivity
- **Military installations:** May have earlier adoption of double-wall systems per DoD requirements
- **Interstate corridors:** Commercial facilities may have upgraded earlier

### Expected Classification Distribution for Alabama

Based on Alabama's data patterns and regulatory timeline, expected distribution:

| Classification | Expected Percentage | Basis |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Single-Walled** | 60-70% | Large number of pre-2016 steel tanks, explicit "Single Wall" designations |
| **Secondary Contained** | 15-25% | Post-2016 installations, explicit "Double Wall," modern FRP and composite |
| **Unknown** | 10-15% | Missing data (NA), pre-1990 FRP without qualifiers, steel tanks without dates |

**Actual distribution will vary based on:**
- Installation date distribution in dataset
- Tank closure/removal patterns
- Data quality and completeness

### Data Quality Specific to Alabama

#### High-Quality Indicators:
1. ✅ Explicit "Single Wall" or "Double Wall" prefixes (found in ~17% of tanks)
2. ✅ Detailed compartment information suggests well-maintained database
3. ✅ Brand name information provides additional validation

#### Data Quality Challenges:
1. ⚠️ 71% of tanks marked simply as "Steel" without wall type qualifier
2. ⚠️ 2.6% marked as "NA" for material
3. ⚠️ Inconsistent notation (e.g., "DBW," "DBL WALL," "DBLWALL," "DBWALL" all mean double-wall)

#### Recommended Data Cleaning:
```r
# Standardize double-wall variations
cleaned_data <- alabama_data %>%
  mutate(
    material_standardized = case_when(
      str_detect(toupper(tank_construction_material), 
                 "DBW|DBL WALL|DBLWALL|DBWALL|DOUBLEWALL|DOUBLE WALL") ~ 
        "Double Wall",
      str_detect(toupper(tank_construction_material), "SINGLE WALL") ~ 
        "Single Wall",
      TRUE ~ tank_construction_material
    )
  )
```

### Alabama Implementation Summary

**Strengths:**
- Clear federal regulatory alignment (SPA approved September 14, 2021)
- Earlier under-dispenser containment requirement (August 6, 2007)
- Explicit wall-type designations in many records
- Well-defined delivery prohibition enforcement mechanism

**Implementation Notes:**
- Installation date is critical for classifying 71% of tanks marked simply as "Steel"
- Fiberglass-coated steel requires careful date-based interpretation
- Brand names provide valuable classification signals
- Missing data rate is manageable at ~2.6%

**Next Steps for Alabama Data:**
1. Validate installation date completeness and accuracy
2. Cross-reference with inspection records if available
3. Apply classification algorithm and review "Unknown" category
4. Conduct county-level analysis for geographic patterns
5. Generate summary statistics for ADEM reporting

## Data Quality Guidelines

### Essential Data Fields

For accurate classification, the following fields are essential:

#### Required Fields
1. **Installation Date** - Must be present and accurate
2. **Tank Material/Construction Type** - At least one material indicator
3. **Tank Status** - Active, Removed, Closed, etc.

#### Highly Recommended Fields
4. **Replacement Date** - If tank was replaced
5. **Upgrade Dates** - CP installation, internal lining, etc.
6. **Double-Wall Indicator** - Explicit flag if available
7. **Capacity** - Helps identify potential errors
8. **Substance Stored** - Petroleum vs. hazardous substance

#### Optional but Valuable Fields
9. **Operator/Owner Information** - For compliance tracking
10. **Inspection History** - Helps validate classification
11. **Geographic Coordinates** - Spatial analysis
12. **Facility Type** - Gas station, airport, government, etc.

### Data Quality Checks

#### Check 1: Date Validity
```r
# Check for impossible or suspicious dates
data %>%
  filter(install_date < as.Date("1930-01-01") | 
         install_date > Sys.Date()) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Dates before 1930 or in the future are likely data entry errors.

#### Check 2: Classification-Date Consistency
```r
# Check for tanks classified as single-walled but installed after secondary requirement
data %>%
  filter(install_date >= state_secondary_req_date,
         classification == "Single_Walled") %>%
  select(tank_id, install_date, classification, all_material_fields)
```

**Issue:** Should be very rare unless tank has specific exemption.

#### Check 3: Upgrade-Material Consistency
```r
# Check for CP upgrade dates on fiberglass tanks (impossible)
data %>%
  filter(material == "Fiberglass",
         !is.na(cp_upgrade_date)) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Cathodic protection only applies to steel tanks.

#### Check 4: Status-Date Consistency
```r
# Check for removed tanks with future dates
data %>%
  filter(status == "Removed",
         removed_date > Sys.Date()) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Cannot remove tanks in the future.

#### Check 5: Conflicting Material Indicators
```r
# Check for tanks marked as both single and double-walled
data %>%
  filter(double_walled == "Y",
         (asphalt_steel == "Y" | bare_steel == "Y")) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Conflicting indicators suggest data quality problem.

### Handling Missing Data

| Field Missing | Classification Impact | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Installation Date** | High - Cannot apply date-based rules | Flag as "Unknown" unless other strong indicators |
| **Material Type** | High - Core classification factor | Flag as "Unknown" |
| **Upgrade Dates** | Medium - May misclassify upgraded single-wall | Assume no upgrade; may undercount single-walled |
| **Status** | Medium - May include inactive tanks | Filter for active tanks only |
| **Capacity** | Low - Not used in classification | No impact |

### Imputation Strategies (Use with Caution)

#### Strategy 1: Installation Date from Facility Records
```r
# If tank install date missing but facility has other tanks with dates
data %>%
  group_by(facility_id) %>%
  mutate(imputed_install_date = if_else(
    is.na(install_date),
    median(install_date, na.rm = TRUE),
    install_date
  ))
```

**Caution:** Only use if tanks at same facility likely installed together.

#### Strategy 2: Material from Similar Tanks
```r
# If material missing, use most common material for tanks of similar capacity/era
data %>%
  mutate(capacity_bin = cut(capacity, breaks = c(0, 500, 1000, 2000, Inf)),
         year_bin = cut(year(install_date), breaks = c(0, 1988, 2000, 2010, Inf))) %>%
  group_by(capacity_bin, year_bin) %>%
  mutate(imputed_material = if_else(
    is.na(material),
    names(which.max(table(material))),
    material
  ))
```

**Caution:** Only use for exploratory analysis; document imputation clearly.

## Validation Framework

### Classification Validation Metrics

#### Metric 1: Distribution Reasonableness

**Expected Pattern:**
```
Pre-1988 installations: Mostly Single-Walled (with some unknowns)
1988-2008: Mostly Single-Walled
Post-2008 (or post-state requirement): Mostly Secondary Contained
Post-2016: Almost entirely Secondary Contained
```

**R Code:**
```r
data %>%
  mutate(era = case_when(
    install_date < as.Date("1988-12-22") ~ "Pre-1988",
    install_date < as.Date("2008-12-20") ~ "1988-2008",
    install_date < as.Date("2016-04-11") ~ "2008-2016",
    TRUE ~ "Post-2016"
  )) %>%
  count(era, classification) %>%
  group_by(era) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = classification, values_from = c(n, percentage))
```

#### Metric 2: Confidence Distribution

**Expected Pattern:**
```
High + Very High confidence: >70% of classifications
Medium confidence: 15-25%
Low confidence: <15%
```

**R Code:**
```r
data %>%
  count(classification_confidence) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)
```

#### Metric 3: Unknown Rate

**Target:** <10% of active tanks classified as "Unknown"

**R Code:**
```r
data %>%
  filter(status == "Active") %>%
  summarize(
    total = n(),
    unknown = sum(classification == "Unknown"),
    unknown_rate = unknown / total * 100
  )
```

#### Metric 4: Cross-Validation with Inspections

If inspection data available:
```r
# Compare classifications with inspector observations
data %>%
  inner_join(inspection_data, by = "tank_id") %>%
  count(classification, inspector_noted_double_wall) %>%
  # Expect high agreement
  mutate(agreement = (classification == "Secondary_Contained" & 
                      inspector_noted_double_wall == "Yes") |
                     (classification == "Single_Walled" & 
                      inspector_noted_double_wall == "No"))
```

### Outlier Detection

#### Outlier 1: Post-2016 Single-Walled Tanks
```r
# Should be rare or non-existent
data %>%
  filter(install_date >= as.Date("2016-04-11"),
         classification == "Single_Walled") %>%
  select(facility_name, tank_id, install_date, material, 
         classification, classification_citation)
```

**Expected Result:** Empty or very few records (exemptions only)

#### Outlier 2: Pre-1990 Secondary Contained Tanks
```r
# Uncommon but possible (early adopters)
data %>%
  filter(install_date < as.Date("1990-01-01"),
         classification == "Secondary_Contained") %>%
  count(material, year = year(install_date))
```

**Expected Result:** Small number, primarily newer materials or special facilities

#### Outlier 3: Tanks with Upgrade Dates After Installation Date + 30 years
```r
# Likely data entry error or remarkable longevity
data %>%
  filter(!is.na(cp_upgrade_date),
         !is.na(install_date),
         cp_upgrade_date - install_date > 365 * 30) %>%
  select(facility_name, tank_id, install_date, cp_upgrade_date,
         age_at_upgrade = (cp_upgrade_date - install_date) / 365)
```

**Expected Result:** Few records; tanks >30 years at upgrade time are rare

### State Comparison Analysis

When multiple states are implemented:
```r
# Compare secondary containment rates across states
all_states_data %>%
  filter(status == "Active",
         install_date >= as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(state, classification) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = classification, values_from = percentage)
```

**Expected Pattern:** States with earlier secondary containment requirements should show higher percentages of secondary contained tanks.

# APPENDIX B: State Program Approval (SPA) Status

## Overview of State Program Approval

Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act allows state UST programs approved by EPA to operate in lieu of the federal program. The state program approval (SPA) regulations set criteria for states to obtain the authority to operate in lieu of the federal program. State programs must be at least as stringent as EPA's.

## SPA Status by State (as of January 2026)

**Note:** All 50 states plus DC and territories have UST programs. SPA status refers to EPA approval to operate *in lieu of* federal program.

### States WITH State Program Approval (SPA)
*These states' programs operate instead of the federal program*

### States WITHOUT State Program Approval
*Federal and state requirements both apply*

| State/Territory | Implementing Agency | Federal + State Requirements |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Alaska | Dept of Environmental Conservation | Both apply |
| Arizona | Dept of Environmental Quality | Both apply |
| California | State Water Resources Control Board | Both apply |
| Michigan | Bureau of Fire Services | Both apply |
| New Jersey | Dept of Environmental Protection | Both apply |
| New York | Dept of Environmental Conservation | Both apply |
| American Samoa | EPA Region 9 | Federal applies |
| Guam | EPA Region 9 | Federal applies |
| Northern Mariana Islands | EPA Region 9 | Federal applies |
| US Virgin Islands | EPA Region 2 | Federal applies |

**Important Note:** While both federal and state regulations apply in states without SPA, the state regulations are generally just as stringent as, and oftentimes significantly more stringent than, EPA's regulations.

### Indian Country
**All Indian country:** Federal UST regulations apply directly (EPA enforcement). State regulations do NOT apply on tribal lands unless specifically adopted by the tribe.

## Implications for Data Classification

### For SPA States:
- Follow state-specific requirements in classification algorithm
- State regulatory dates take precedence over federal dates if more stringent
- Citation should reference state regulations

### For Non-SPA States:
- Must comply with BOTH federal and state requirements
- Use whichever requirement is more stringent
- Classification may require checking both sets of regulations

# APPENDIX C: Glossary

## Technical Terms

**Automatic Tank Gauging (ATG):** Electronic monitoring system that measures product level and can detect leaks through inventory reconciliation.

**Cathodic Protection (CP):** Electrochemical method of preventing corrosion by making the tank the cathode of an electrical circuit. Types include:
- **Impressed Current:** Uses external power source
- **Sacrificial Anode:** Uses more reactive metal that corrodes instead of tank

**Composite Tank:** Tank constructed of multiple materials, typically steel inner wall with fiberglass outer wall, providing secondary containment.

**Dispenser:** Equipment that dispenses petroleum from a UST system, typically a gas pump.

**Double-Walled:** Construction with two complete walls separated by an interstitial space that can be monitored for leaks.

**Excavation Zone Liner:** Synthetic or concrete barrier placed in excavation around tank to provide secondary containment.

**Field-Constructed Tank:** UST assembled on-site rather than manufactured in a factory. Common for very large tanks.

**Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic (FRP):** Non-corrosive material made of fiberglass and resin, commonly used for modern UST construction.

**Hazardous Substance:** As defined by CERCLA § 101(14), any substance designated under Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, CERCLA, or listed as hazardous waste under RCRA. Distinguished from petroleum.

**Impressed Current:** Type of cathodic protection using external electrical power source to protect tank from corrosion.

**Interstitial Monitoring:** Continuous or periodic monitoring of the space between double walls to detect leaks from primary containment.

**Interstitial Space:** The physical gap between inner and outer walls of a double-walled tank or piping, monitored for leaks.

**Internal Lining:** Protective coating applied to interior of steel tanks to prevent corrosion from product contact.

**Jacketed Tank:** Primary tank surrounded by an outer jacket, similar to double-walled but may have different construction standards.

**Leak Detection:** General term for methods to discover releases, including monitoring wells, tank tightness testing, inventory reconciliation, etc.

**Operator Training:** EPA requirement (40 CFR § 280.242-245) for three classes of trained operators (A, B, C) at each facility.

**Overfill Prevention:** Equipment (automatic shutoff, flow restrictors, high-level alarms) that prevents tank overfilling during delivery.

**Petroleum:** Defined in 40 CFR § 280.12 as petroleum-based substances including crude oil, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, and petroleum-based solvents. Excludes animal or vegetable oils.

**Piping:** Underground lines that convey petroleum from UST to dispenser or other equipment. Divided into:
- **Pressurized Piping:** Under pressure when product flows
- **Suction Piping:** Under suction when product flows

**Primary Containment:** The first barrier that directly holds the regulated substance.

**Release:** Any spilling, leaking, emitting, discharging, escaping, leaching, or disposing from a UST into groundwater, surface water, or subsurface soils.

**Release Detection:** Methods required by 40 CFR § 280.40-45 to determine if product has been released from the UST system.

**Sacrificial Anode:** Type of cathodic protection using a more reactive metal (zinc, magnesium) that corrodes preferentially, protecting the steel tank.

**Secondary Containment:** Complete dual-barrier system with interstitial monitoring that contains and detects releases before environmental impact.

**Spill Prevention:** Equipment (catch basins, spill buckets) that captures drips and spills when delivery hose is disconnected from fill pipe.
