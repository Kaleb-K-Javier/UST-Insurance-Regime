# PART I: FEDERAL FOUNDATION

## Executive Summary

This document provides a standardized framework for classifying underground storage tanks (USTs) based on their construction type across all U.S. jurisdictions. The classification system is built on federal EPA regulations and can be adapted to incorporate state-specific requirements.

### Classification Categories
1. **Single-Walled UST** - Primary containment only
2. **Secondary Contained UST** - Double-walled or with secondary barrier and interstitial monitoring
3. **Unknown** - Insufficient data for classification

### Regulatory Authority Hierarchy
```
Federal Baseline (EPA 40 CFR Part 280)
    ↓
State Regulations (Must be "no less stringent")
    ↓
Local/County Requirements (Additional restrictions permitted)
```

**Critical Principle:** State regulations must be **at least as stringent** as federal requirements but may impose more restrictive standards.

## Federal Regulatory Framework

### Governing Statutes

#### 1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) - Subtitle I
**Citation:** 42 U.S.C. § 6991 et seq.  
**Enacted:** November 8, 1984 (Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments)  
**Authority:** Grants EPA authority to regulate USTs containing petroleum or hazardous substances  
**URL:** https://www.epa.gov/rcra/resource-conservation-and-recovery-act-rcra-overview

**Key Provisions:**
- Section 9003 (42 U.S.C. § 6991b): Notification requirements
- Section 9004 (42 U.S.C. § 6991c): State program approval authority
- Section 9005 (42 U.S.C. § 6991d): EPA inspection and monitoring
- Section 9006 (42 U.S.C. § 6991e): Federal enforcement

#### 2. Energy Policy Act of 2005 - Section 1530
**Citation:** Public Law 109-58, 119 Stat. 1075  
**Enacted:** August 8, 2005  
**URL:** https://www.epa.gov/ust/secondary-containment-underground-storage-tank-systems-2005-energy-policy-act

**Key Requirements (Section 1530):**
Secondary containment requires that new or replaced tanks and piping within 1,000 feet of an existing community water system or an existing potable drinking water well must be secondarily contained (this includes interstitial monitoring).

States receiving federal UST funds must require EITHER:
- **Option A:** Secondary containment + under-dispenser containment for new/replaced systems within 1,000 feet of drinking water sources
- **Option B:** Enhanced financial responsibility + installer certification

**Implementation Note:** Most states chose Option A (secondary containment).

### Federal Regulations

**2015 Revision Summary (80 FR 41566):**

This is the first major revision to the federal UST regulations since 1988. The 2015 UST regulation changed certain portions of the 1988 underground storage tank technical regulation in 40 CFR part 280.

Changes to the regulations include: Adding secondary containment requirements for new and replaced tanks and piping; adding operator training requirements; adding periodic operation and maintenance requirements for UST systems; addressing UST systems deferred in the 1988 UST regulation; adding new release prevention and detection technologies; updating codes of practice; making editorial corrections and technical amendments; and updating state program approval requirements to incorporate these new changes.

#### 40 CFR Part 281 - State Program Approval
**Original Promulgation:** September 23, 1988 (53 FR 37194)  
**Major Revision:** July 15, 2015 (80 FR 41566)  
**URL:** https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-40/chapter-I/subchapter-I/part-281

**Key Requirements for State Program Approval:**
1. Program must be "no less stringent" than federal standards (40 CFR § 281.30)
2. Must regulate at least the same USTs as federal program (40 CFR § 281.31)
3. Must have adequate authority for compliance monitoring and enforcement (40 CFR § 281.32)
4. Must maintain and make available records and reports (40 CFR § 281.36)

Under the 2015 state program approval (SPA) regulation, the 38 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, which currently have SPA, must reapply by October 13, 2018 in order to retain their SPA status.

**State Program Approval Status:**
- As of January 2026, 52 states and territories have updated their regulations to incorporate the 2015 federal requirements
- States WITH SPA: Owners/operators follow state requirements
- States WITHOUT SPA: Owners/operators must comply with both federal AND state requirements

## Universal Classification Categories

### Definition Framework

#### Category 1: Single-Walled UST
**Definition:** An underground storage tank with only primary containment and no secondary barrier for leak detection and containment.

**Characteristics:**
- Single structural barrier between stored product and environment
- May have corrosion protection (cathodic protection, internal lining, coatings)
- May have leak detection equipment (monitoring wells, ATG, etc.)
- Corrosion protection ≠ Secondary containment

**Federal Recognition:** 40 CFR § 280.20(a) recognizes single-walled tanks installed before December 22, 1988 if properly upgraded with corrosion protection and leak detection.

#### Category 2: Secondary Contained UST
**Definition:** Secondary containment means the tank and piping have an inner and outer barrier with an interstitial space that is monitored for leaks and includes containment sumps when those sumps are used for interstitial monitoring of the piping.

**Required Components (per 40 CFR § 280.20(d)):**
1. **Dual Barriers:** Inner (primary) and outer (secondary) containment
2. **Interstitial Space:** Monitored area between the two barriers
3. **Leak Detection:** Continuous or periodic monitoring of interstitial space
4. **Liquid Tightness:** Both barriers must prevent product escape

**Acceptable Secondary Containment Methods:**
- **Double-walled tanks:** Factory-manufactured tank within a tank
- **Jacketed tanks:** Outer jacket surrounding primary tank
- **Composite construction:** Steel inner tank with fiberglass outer shell
- **Excavation zone liner:** Synthetic or concrete liner surrounding tank (must meet specific criteria)

**Federal Requirement Triggers:**
1. All new UST tanks and piping installed after April 11, 2016 (40 CFR § 280.20(d))
2. Replacement of existing tank (removal of tank and installation of another)
3. Replacement of 50% or more of any piping run connected to a tank

#### Category 3: Unknown
**Definition:** Classification cannot be determined from available data.

**Common Reasons:**
- No material construction type (MCT) data available
- Conflicting indicators in data
- Pre-1990 fiberglass tanks without additional information
- Missing installation dates
- Data quality issues

### Detailed Federal Requirements

#### Pre-December 22, 1988 Installation

**Regulatory Status (40 CFR § 280.21):**
- Original installation did NOT require corrosion protection or release detection
- Must have been UPGRADED by December 22, 1998 with:
  - Corrosion protection (cathodic protection, internal lining, or non-corrodible material)
  - Release detection (monitoring, testing, or leak detection equipment)

**Classification Implication:**
- Vast majority are **single-walled** tanks that received upgrades
- Secondary containment was NOT required; upgrades added protection to single-walled systems
- If no upgrade documented → likely out of compliance or closed

#### December 22, 1988 - April 10, 2016 Installation

**Regulatory Status (40 CFR § 280.20(a-c)):**
- Required corrosion protection at installation
- Required release detection
- Secondary containment NOT federally required (except under Energy Policy Act conditions)

**Classification Implication:**
- Default assumption: **single-walled with corrosion protection**
- Exception: Some states required secondary containment earlier than federal requirement
- Check state-specific requirements for this period

#### Post-April 11, 2016 Installation or Replacement

**Regulatory Status (40 CFR § 280.20(d)):**

Beginning on April 11, 2016, owners and operators must install secondarily contained tanks and piping when installing or replacing tanks and piping. Owners and operators must use interstitial monitoring as release detection for these new or replaced tanks and piping.

**"Replaced" Definitions:**
- **Tank:** Replaced for a tank means to remove a tank and install another tank
- **Piping:** Replaced for piping means to remove 50 percent or more of piping and install other piping

**Classification Implication:**
- All new tanks/piping: **Secondary Contained** (federal requirement)
- All replacement tanks/piping: **Secondary Contained** (federal requirement)
- Repairs not triggering replacement threshold: May remain single-walled

## Tank Construction Types & Materials

### Material Construction Type Classifications

Understanding the material construction is essential for classification. The following framework applies universally across all jurisdictions.

#### Steel Tank Constructions

##### Single-Walled Steel Indicators

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Federal Standard |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Bare steel (unprotected) | BARE_STEEL | Single-Walled | Non-compliant (unless pre-1988) |
| Steel with asphalt coating, no cathodic protection | STL_ASPH_NOCP | Single-Walled | Non-compliant (unless upgraded) |
| Steel with asphalt coating, without cathodic protection | STL_ASPH_WOCP | Single-Walled | Non-compliant (unless upgraded) |

##### Single-Walled Steel with Corrosion Protection

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Federal Standard |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Cathodically protected steel - impressed current | CP_STEEL_IC | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(2)) |
| Cathodically protected steel - sacrificial anode | CP_STEEL_SAC | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(2)) |
| Cathodically protected steel with internal lining | CP_STEEL_INT_LINE | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(3)) |
| Epoxy-coated steel | EPOXY_COAT_STL | Single-Walled | Compliant if properly installed |
| Internally lined steel tank | INT_LINED_STEEL | Single-Walled | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(a)(3)) |
| Asphalt-coated steel (general) | ASPH_STEEL | Single-Walled | Requires CP upgrade |

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Cathodic protection (CP) is an **upgrade method** per 40 CFR § 280.21. It provides corrosion protection to single-walled tanks but does NOT create secondary containment.

**Federal Definition (40 CFR § 280.12):**
> "Upgrade means the addition or retrofit of some systems such as cathodic protection, lining, or spill and overfill controls to improve the ability of an underground storage tank system to prevent the release of product."

##### Secondary Contained Steel

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Federal Standard |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Double-walled steel | DOUBLE_WALL_STL | Secondary Contained | Compliant (40 CFR 280.20(d)) |
| Composite steel and fiberglass | COMP_STL_FBRGLS | Secondary Contained | Compliant if properly specified |

#### Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic (FRP) Constructions

**Manufacturing Standards:** UL 1316 - "Glass-Fiber-Reinforced Plastic Underground Storage Tanks for Petroleum Products, Alcohols, and Alcohol-Gasoline Mixtures"

**Federal Recognition:** 40 CFR § 280.20(b) - Tanks must be constructed of fiberglass-reinforced plastic in accordance with UL Standard 1316.

##### Single-Walled FRP

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Single-wall fiberglass | FRP_SINGLE | Single-Walled | Common in 1970s-1980s |
| Single-wall plastic | PLASTIC_SINGLE | Single-Walled | Less common for USTs |

##### Secondary Contained FRP

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Double-walled fiberglass | FRP_DOUBLE | Secondary Contained | Industry standard post-1990 |
| Fiberglass with jacket | FRP_JACKET | Secondary Contained | Factory-installed secondary barrier |

**Fiberglass Classification Logic:**
```
IF material = "Fiberglass" OR "FRP" OR "Plastic":
    IF install_date >= January 1, 1990:
        THEN Classification = "Secondary Contained" (medium-high confidence)
        REASON: Industry predominantly shifted to double-wall by 1990
    ELSE IF install_date < January 1, 1990:
        THEN Classification = "Unknown"
        REASON: Mix of single and double-wall during this period
    END IF
END IF
```

**Rationale:** While both single-wall and double-wall fiberglass tanks are UL-listed, the industry predominantly adopted double-wall construction by 1990 as best practice. States may have different cutoff dates based on their specific requirements.

#### Concrete and Field-Constructed Tanks

**Regulatory History:** Field-constructed tanks were **deferred** from the original 1988 regulations but were brought under regulation in the 2015 revision.

| Construction Type | Code/Abbreviation | Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Concrete single-wall | CONCRETE_SINGLE | Single-Walled | Rare; mostly historical |
| Concrete with liner | CONCRETE_LINER | Context-dependent | Depends on liner specifications |
| Field-constructed (any material) | FIELD_CONSTRUCT | Context-dependent | Now regulated under 40 CFR 280.251 |

**Field-Constructed Tank Requirements (40 CFR § 280.251):**
- Tanks installed after October 13, 2015: Must meet same standards as shop-fabricated tanks
- Tanks installed on/before October 13, 2015: Must have release detection by October 13, 2018

#### Excavation Zone Liners

**Definition:** A synthetic or concrete barrier placed in the excavation around a tank to provide secondary containment.

**Federal Requirements (40 CFR § 280.20):**
- Must surround tank on all sides
- Must be inspectable or testable
- May satisfy secondary containment if properly designed and monitored

**Classification:** If properly documented → **Secondary Contained**

### Tank Material Summary Table

| Material Category | Typical Era | Default Classification | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------------|-------|
| Bare Steel | Pre-1988 | Single-Walled | Non-compliant unless upgraded |
| Steel + Asphalt | 1950s-1980s | Single-Walled | Common legacy tanks |
| Steel + CP | 1988-2016 | Single-Walled | Compliant single-wall |
| Steel + Internal Lining | 1988-2016 | Single-Walled | Compliant single-wall |
| Double-Wall Steel | Any | Secondary Contained | |
| Composite Steel/FRP | 1990s+ | Secondary Contained | |
| Single-Wall FRP | 1970s-1990s | Single-Walled | Less common after 1990 |
| Double-Wall FRP | 1990s+ | Secondary Contained | Industry standard |
| Concrete | Pre-1990 | Context-dependent | Rare for USTs |

## Secondary Containment: Federal Definition

### Regulatory Definition

**40 CFR § 280.12:**
> "Secondary containment or secondarily contained means a release prevention and release detection system for a tank or piping. This system has an inner and outer barrier with an interstitial space that is monitored for leaks. This term includes containment sumps when used for interstitial monitoring of piping."

### Required Components

#### 1. Dual Barrier System
- **Primary (Inner) Barrier:** Contains the regulated substance under normal operations
- **Secondary (Outer) Barrier:** Contains releases from the primary barrier and prevents soil/groundwater contamination

#### 2. Interstitial Space
- Physical space between inner and outer barriers
- Must allow for monitoring or inspection
- May contain monitoring fluid (colored glycol solution) or be dry with sensors

#### 3. Leak Detection/Monitoring
**40 CFR § 280.43(g) - Interstitial Monitoring:**
- Must be capable of detecting a release through the inner wall
- May use continuous electronic monitoring or periodic visual/manual inspection
- For double-walled systems, must monitor the space between the walls

**Methods:**
- Electronic sensors with alarms
- Hydrostatic monitoring (liquid-filled interstitial space)
- Vacuum monitoring (pressure decay testing)
- Visual inspection (for accessible secondary containment)

#### 4. Liquid-Tight Construction
- Both barriers must prevent product passage
- Penetrations (manholes, fill pipes, etc.) must maintain integrity
- Testing required: Per 40 CFR § 280.43(g), must test within 30 days of installation and every 3 years thereafter

### What DOES Qualify as Secondary Containment

| System Type | Description | Federal Citation |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Double-walled tank** | Factory-manufactured tank within a tank | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Jacketed tank** | Primary tank with outer jacket, monitored interstitial space | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Composite tank** | Inner steel tank, outer FRP shell with interstitial monitoring | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Tank with excavation zone liner** | Primary tank + synthetic liner surrounding excavation with monitoring | 40 CFR 280.20(d) |
| **Double-walled piping** | Pipe within a pipe with interstitial monitoring | 40 CFR 280.43(g) |
| **Piping in containment sump** | Single-wall pipe within monitored containment sump | 40 CFR 280.43(g) |

### What DOES NOT Qualify as Secondary Containment

| System Type | Reason | Federal Guidance |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| **Cathodic protection** | No secondary barrier; only corrosion prevention | Upgrade per 280.21, not secondary containment |
| **Internal tank lining** | No secondary barrier; only corrosion prevention | Upgrade per 280.21, not secondary containment |
| **Epoxy coatings** | No secondary barrier; only corrosion prevention | 40 CFR 280.20(a)(3) |
| **Monitoring wells** | Leak detection, not containment | 40 CFR 280.43 (release detection, not containment) |
| **Spill buckets** | Captures spills at fill pipe, not tank containment | 40 CFR 280.20(c)(1)(i) |
| **Overfill prevention** | Prevents overfills, not containment | 40 CFR 280.20(c)(1)(ii) |
| **Vapor monitoring** | Detects releases, doesn't contain them | 40 CFR 280.43(e) |
| **Groundwater monitoring** | Detects releases, doesn't contain them | 40 CFR 280.43(d) |

---

## Upgrades vs. Secondary Containment

### The Critical Distinction

**This is perhaps the most important concept in UST classification.**

#### Upgrades (40 CFR § 280.21)

**Definition:** "Upgrade means the addition or retrofit of some systems such as cathodic protection, lining, or spill and overfill controls to improve the ability of an underground storage tank system to prevent the release of product."

**Purpose:** Make existing single-walled tanks COMPLIANT with federal standards

**Historical Context:** 
- Original 1988 regulation required existing tanks to be upgraded by December 22, 1998
- Upgrades allow single-walled tanks to meet performance standards without replacement
- Upgraded tanks remain single-walled but are code-compliant

**Common Upgrade Methods:**

1. **Cathodic Protection (CP)**
   - **Method:** Impressed current or sacrificial anode system
   - **Purpose:** Prevents external corrosion of steel tanks
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.20(a)(2) & § 280.21(b)(1)
   - **Testing:** Must be tested every 3 years (40 CFR § 280.31)
   - **Classification Impact:** Tank remains **single-walled**

2. **Internal Lining**
   - **Method:** Epoxy or fiberglass coating applied to interior of steel tank
   - **Purpose:** Prevents internal corrosion from product
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.21(b)(2)
   - **Inspection:** Must be internally inspected every 10 years (40 CFR § 280.21(b)(2))
   - **Classification Impact:** Tank remains **single-walled**

3. **Combination: CP + Internal Lining**
   - **Method:** Both cathodic protection AND internal lining
   - **Purpose:** Prevents both internal and external corrosion
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.21(b)(3)
   - **Classification Impact:** Tank remains **single-walled**

4. **Spill/Overfill Prevention Equipment**
   - **Method:** Installation of catchment basins, automatic shutoff devices
   - **Purpose:** Prevents releases during filling operations
   - **Federal Requirement:** 40 CFR § 280.20(c)
   - **Classification Impact:** Does not affect tank wall classification

#### Secondary Containment (40 CFR § 280.20(d))

**Definition:** Dual-barrier system with interstitial monitoring

**Purpose:** CONTAIN and DETECT releases before environmental impact

**Implementation:** 
- Required for all new/replaced tanks and piping after April 11, 2016
- Cannot be retroactively added to existing single-walled tanks (would require tank replacement)
- Creates **secondary contained** classification

**Methods:**
- Double-walled tank installation
- Tank replacement with secondary contained unit
- Piping replacement (≥50%) with double-walled piping

### Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Upgrade (40 CFR 280.21) | Secondary Containment (40 CFR 280.20(d)) |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Make existing single-wall compliant | Provide dual-barrier protection |
| **Applied To** | Existing tanks in place | New or replacement tanks |
| **Tank Walls** | Single barrier | Double barrier (inner + outer) |
| **Release Prevention** | Corrosion protection | Physical containment |
| **Release Detection** | External methods (monitoring, testing) | Interstitial monitoring |
| **Cost** | Lower (retrofit) | Higher (new tank required) |
| **Federal Deadline** | December 22, 1998 (for existing tanks) | April 11, 2016 (for new/replaced tanks) |
| **Classification** | Single-Walled (upgraded) | Secondary Contained |

### Data Field Implications

Many UST databases contain fields for upgrade dates. Understanding what these mean:

| Field Name | Typical Meaning | Classification Impact |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `initial_cp_upgrade_date` | Date cathodic protection first installed | Indicates single-walled tank that received CP upgrade |
| `subsequent_cp_upgrade_date` | Date of CP system repairs/retesting | Ongoing maintenance of single-walled system |
| `internal_lining_date` | Date tank interior was lined | Indicates single-walled tank that received lining upgrade |
| `compliance_upgrade_date` | Date tank met 1998 deadline | Generic upgrade; likely remains single-walled |
| `replacement_date` | Date tank was replaced | If after April 11, 2016 → Secondary Contained |

**Key Takeaway:** Upgrade dates indicate the tank was and remains **single-walled** unless explicitly replaced with a secondary contained system.

## Universal Classification Algorithm

### Decision Tree Framework

This algorithm provides a universal approach to classifying USTs. State-specific adjustments are incorporated in Part II.

```
START CLASSIFICATION

1. CHECK INSTALLATION/REPLACEMENT DATE

   IF installation_date >= State Secondary Containment Requirement Date:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: State law requires secondary containment
      
   ELSE IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Federal secondary containment requirement (40 CFR 280.20(d))
      
   ELSE IF replacement_date >= April 11, 2016:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Federal secondary containment requirement for replacements

2. CHECK EXPLICIT DOUBLE-WALL INDICATORS

   ELSE IF double_walled = TRUE OR double_wall_flag = "Y":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Explicitly marked as double-walled construction
      
   ELSE IF composite_steel_fiberglass = TRUE:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Composite construction is inherently double-walled
      
   ELSE IF excavation_zone_liner = TRUE:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
      REASON: Liner provides secondary containment if properly monitored

3. CHECK FIBERGLASS/PLASTIC MATERIALS (DATE-DEPENDENT)

   ELSE IF (material = "Fiberglass" OR material = "FRP" OR material = "Plastic"):
      IF installation_date >= January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Industry standard post-1990 is double-wall FRP
      ELSE IF installation_date < January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: Mix of single and double-wall FRP before 1990
      END IF

4. CHECK SINGLE-WALL STEEL INDICATORS

   ELSE IF bare_steel = TRUE:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Unprotected bare steel (likely non-compliant unless pre-1988)
      
   ELSE IF asphalt_steel = TRUE AND cathodic_protection = NULL:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Asphalt-coated steel without CP upgrade
      
   ELSE IF asphalt_steel_without_cp = TRUE:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Explicitly marked without cathodic protection

5. CHECK UPGRADE INDICATORS (SINGLE-WALL WITH PROTECTION)

   ELSE IF initial_cp_upgrade_date IS NOT NULL:
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)

### Confidence Scoring

Classification confidence should be tracked alongside the classification itself:

| Confidence Level | Criteria | Examples |
|------------------|----------|----------|
| **High** | Explicit data field or regulatory requirement | • `double_walled = TRUE`<br>• Install date after April 11, 2016<br>• `cp_upgrade_date` populated |
| **Medium-High** | Strong inference from data patterns | • Fiberglass tank installed 1995<br>• Composite construction<br>• State requirement met |
| **Medium** | Reasonable inference with some uncertainty | • Asphalt steel, no CP data<br>• Upgrade indicators present |
| **Low** | Weak inference or insufficient data | • Pre-1990 fiberglass<br>• Conflicting indicators<br>• Missing key fields |

# PART II: STATE-SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION

## Louisiana Implementation

### Overview

Louisiana has implemented UST regulations that are **more stringent** than federal requirements, particularly regarding the secondary containment mandate date.

**Implementing Agency:** Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ), Single Event Upset Section  
**State Program Approval Status:** Approved State Program (SPA)  
**Federal Register Approval:** June 4, 2020 (85 FR 34287)  
**URL:** https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/04/2020-09941/louisiana-final-approval-of-state-underground-storage-tank-program-revisions

### Louisiana Regulatory Framework

#### State Statutes
**Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 30 - Environmental Quality Act**
- La. R.S. 30:2001 et seq. - Underground Storage Tanks

#### State Regulations
**Louisiana Administrative Code (LAC) Title 33, Part XI - Underground Storage Tanks**
**URL:** https://www.doa.la.gov/media/dbzfugdz/33v11.pdf

**Key Sections:**
- **LAC 33:XI.101** - Applicability
- **LAC 33:XI.303** - Performance Standards for New UST Systems

### Louisiana-Specific Requirements

#### 1. Secondary Containment Requirement - EARLIER THAN FEDERAL

**LAC 33:XI.303.C.1:**
> "All UST systems installed after December 20, 2008, shall have secondary containment with interstitial monitoring for tanks and piping."

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Louisiana Requirement:** December 20, 2008
- **Federal Requirement:** April 11, 2016
- **Difference:** Louisiana mandate is **7 years, 4 months** earlier than federal

**Components Required (LAC 33:XI.303.C):**
1. **Tanks:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring
2. **Piping:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring
3. **Monitoring:** Monthly inspection of interstitial space
4. **Under-Dispenser Containment:** Required per LAC 33:XI.303.D.4
5. **Submersible Turbine Pump Containment:** Required under certain conditions (LAC 33:XI.303.D.5)

**URL:** https://deq.louisiana.gov/page/secondary-containment-or-financial-responsibilityinstaller-certification

#### 2. Piping Replacement Trigger - MORE STRINGENT

**LAC 33:XI.303.D.2.g:**
> "If twenty-five percent (25%) or more of a piping run is replaced or repaired, the entire piping run shall be made secondarily contained with interstitial monitoring."

**Comparison to Federal:**
- **Louisiana Trigger:** 25% of piping run
- **Federal Trigger:** 50% of piping run (40 CFR § 280.20(d))
- **Louisiana is MORE RESTRICTIVE**

#### 3. Under-Dispenser Containment

**LAC 33:XI.303.D.4:**
Required for all new dispenser systems installed after December 20, 2008 (earlier than federal requirement).

#### 4. Emergency Generator USTs

**LAC 33:XI.101.A.1.c:**
Effective August 9, 2009, emergency generator USTs must meet release detection requirements (removed from federal deferral earlier than EPA).

### Louisiana-Specific Timeline

### Louisiana-Specific Considerations

#### 1. Grant Program for Upgrades
Louisiana established a grant program (effective January 1, 2024) to help owners upgrade single-wall systems to double-wall.

**Source:** https://deq.louisiana.gov/page/underground-storage-tank

**Classification Impact:** Tanks upgraded through this program should have documentation showing:
- Original installation date (pre-2008)
- Upgrade/replacement date (post-2024)
- If replacement occurred → Classification changes to "Secondary Contained"

#### 2. Emergency Generator USTs
Louisiana removed the emergency generator deferral earlier than EPA (August 9, 2009 vs. October 13, 2018).

**Classification Impact:** Emergency generator tanks in Louisiana:
- Installed before August 9, 2009: May be single-walled but must have release detection
- Installed after August 9, 2009: Subject to same standards as other USTs

#### 3. Parish-Level Analysis
Louisiana uses "parishes" instead of "counties". When analyzing data:
- Use `parish_desc` field for geographic grouping
- Consider regional differences (e.g., coastal parishes may have more stringent requirements)
- Urban vs. rural parish differences in compliance patterns

#### 4. Hurricane Impacts
Louisiana USTs may have been affected by hurricanes. Check for:
- Gaps in inspection/testing dates
- Emergency replacements after major storms
- FEMA-funded replacement programs (likely resulted in secondary containment)

## Alabama Implementation

### Overview

Alabama has implemented UST regulations through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) that incorporate federal requirements and include specific state provisions for secondary containment and operational requirements.

**Implementing Agency:** Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), Water Division - Water Quality Program  
**State Program Approval Status:** Approved State Program (SPA)  
**Federal Register Approval:** September 14, 2021 (86 FR 51129)  
**Most Recent Regulation Revision:** December 15, 2024  
**URL:** https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/14/2021-19659/alabama-final-approval-of-state-underground-storage-tank-program-revisions

### Alabama Regulatory Framework

#### State Statutes
**Alabama Code Title 22, Chapter 36 - Underground Storage Tank and Wellhead Protection Act of 1988**
- Ala. Code § 22-36-1 et seq. - Underground Storage Tanks
- Enacted: 1988

#### State Regulations
**Alabama Administrative Code (ADEM Admin. Code r.) Chapter 335-6-15**  
**Full Citation:** Technical Standards, Corrective Action Requirements and Financial Responsibility for Owners and Operators of Underground Storage Tanks  
**Revised Effective:** December 15, 2024  
**URL:** https://adem.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Division6Volume2.pdf

**Key Sections:**
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.01** - Purpose
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.02** - Definitions
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06** - Performance Standards for New UST Systems and Dispensers
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.07** - Upgrading of Existing UST Systems
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.09** - Operation, Maintenance, and Testing of Spill and Overfill Prevention Equipment and Containment Systems
- **ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.14** - General Release Detection Requirements for All UST Systems

### Alabama-Specific Requirements

#### 1. Secondary Containment for Dispensers and Sumps - EARLIER THAN FEDERAL

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.02(ss) - "New dispenser system" definition:**
> "New dispenser system is either a newly manufactured or operational dispenser and the equipment necessary to connect the dispenser to the underground storage tank system, which includes check valves, shear valves, unburied risers, flex connectors, or other transitional components which connect the dispenser to the underground piping, which is installed for the first time or at a new location on **August 6, 2007** and thereafter."

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06(g) - Performance Standards:**

New dispenser systems installed on or after **August 6, 2007** must have:
1. **Under-dispenser containment (UDC)** that is liquid-tight on sides and bottom, and capable of containing leaks from dispenser equipment
2. **Overfill prevention** for the under-dispenser containment sump
3. **Submersible turbine pump (STP) containment** when applicable

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Alabama Requirement (Dispensers/Sumps):** August 6, 2007
- **Federal Requirement (Full Secondary Containment):** April 11, 2016
- **Difference:** Alabama mandated under-dispenser and STP containment **8 years, 8 months** earlier than full federal secondary containment

**Note:** This requirement is specific to **dispenser system components**, not complete tank and piping secondary containment. Alabama follows the federal April 11, 2016 date for full secondary containment of tanks and piping.

#### 2. Containment Sump Requirements

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.02(m) - Containment sump definition:**

Alabama defines four types of containment sumps:
1. **UST top sump** (submersible turbine pump sump) - at top of tank
2. **Under-dispenser containment sump** - underneath dispenser
3. **Transition sump** - at piping transitions
4. **Intermediate sump** - at other points in piping run

All containment sumps must be:
- Liquid-tight
- Capable of protecting the environment by containing leaks and spills
- Single-walled or secondarily contained

#### 3. Piping Transition Containment - STATE-SPECIFIC

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.06(h):**

All underground piping installed or replaced on or after **December 8, 2017** must have containment at transitions between:
- Double-walled piping and single-walled components
- Different piping materials
- Piping and equipment

This is a **state-specific requirement** not found in federal regulations.

#### 4. Operator Training Requirements

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.46 - Operator Training:**

Alabama requires three classes of operators:
- **Class A Operator:** Primary responsibility for operation and maintenance
- **Class B Operator:** Day-to-day implementation and recordkeeping
- **Class C Operator:** First line of response to emergencies

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Federal requirement: October 13, 2016
- Alabama incorporated this into state regulations per SPA

#### 5. Delivery Prohibition Authority

**ADEM Admin. Code r. 335-6-15-.45 - Delivery Prohibition:**

Alabama has specific authority to prohibit delivery of regulated substances ("red tag") for:
1. **Significant noncompliance requiring delivery prohibition** - immediate prohibition
2. **Significant noncompliance subject to delivery prohibition** - prohibition after notice and time to comply

This enforcement mechanism is more explicitly defined than federal regulations.

1. **"Steel" without qualifier:** 71.2% of tanks - requires installation date analysis
2. **Explicit "Single Wall" prefix:** 8.0% + 2.0% + 0.9% = 10.9% explicitly marked
3. **Explicit "Double Wall" prefix:** 3.2% + 2.4% + 0.4% = 6.0% explicitly marked
4. **"Fiberglass coated steel":** Composite construction (steel + fiberglass outer layer)
5. **Missing data (NA):** 2.6% of tanks

START ALABAMA CLASSIFICATION

1. FEDERAL SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DATE (Tanks and Piping)

   IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Very High Confidence)

      CITATION: 40 CFR 280.20(d)

2. EXPLICIT DOUBLE-WALL INDICATORS IN DATA

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Double Wall":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Explicitly marked as double-walled construction in Alabama database
      CITATION: Data field indicator
      
   ELSE IF tank_construction_material_select = "Double Wall":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
      REASON: Simplified field indicates double-wall
      CITATION: Data field indicator

3. COMPOSITE CONSTRUCTION (Fiberglass Coated Steel)

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Fiberglass coated steel" AND NOT "Single Wall":
      IF installation_date >= January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Modern fiberglass-coated steel is typically composite (steel inner, FRP outer)
      ELSE:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: Early fiberglass-coated steel may be single-wall with coating
      END IF

4. FIBERGLASS REINFORCED PLASTIC (DATE-DEPENDENT)

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Fiberglass reinforced plastic" AND NOT "Single Wall":
      IF installation_date >= January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Industry standard post-1990 is double-wall FRP
      ELSE IF installation_date < January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: Mix of single and double-wall FRP before 1990
      END IF

5. EXPLICIT SINGLE-WALL INDICATORS

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "Single Wall":
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)

      IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (High Confidence)
         REASON: Post-federal requirement, all new steel tanks must be double-wall
      ELSE IF installation_date >= January 1, 2000:
         RETURN "Single-Walled" (Medium Confidence)
         REASON: Likely single-wall steel with CP; no state requirement for secondary containment
      ELSE IF installation_date < January 1, 2000:
         RETURN "Single-Walled" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Pre-2000 steel tanks are predominantly single-wall
      ELSE IF installation_date IS NULL:

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS ("GLASTEEL" OR "GLAS STEEL"):
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
      REASON: Glasteel typically refers to composite double-wall construction
      
   ELSE IF tank_construction_material CONTAINS "TITAN":
      RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium Confidence)
      REASON: Titan brand typically double-wall, but verify with install date

8. MISSING DATA

   ELSE IF tank_construction_material = "NA" OR tank_construction_material IS NULL:
      IF installation_date >= April 11, 2016:
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium Confidence)
         REASON: Federal requirement despite missing material data
      ELSE:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)

### Alabama-Specific Considerations

#### 1. High Proportion of Unqualified "Steel" Tanks

**Challenge:** 71.2% of Alabama tanks (37,415) are simply marked as "Steel" without "Single Wall" or "Double Wall" qualifier.

**Approach:**
- Use installation date as primary classification factor
- Pre-2000 steel tanks: Classify as "Single-Walled" (medium-high confidence)
- 2000-2016 steel tanks: Classify as "Single-Walled" (medium confidence) - no state secondary containment requirement
- Post-2016 steel tanks: Classify as "Secondary Contained" (high confidence) - federal requirement

**Validation Needed:** Sample inspection data or upgrade records could increase confidence for unqualified steel tanks.

#### 2. Fiberglass-Coated Steel Interpretation

**Alabama Pattern:** "Fiberglass coated steel" appears in 1,650 tanks plus variants.

**Industry Context:** 
- **Composite construction:** Steel inner tank with fiberglass outer shell = secondary containment
- **Single-wall coated:** Steel tank with fiberglass coating/lining = single-walled

**Alabama Classification Approach:**
- If marked "Fiberglass coated steel" WITHOUT "Single Wall" AND installed post-1990 → Classify as "Secondary Contained" (medium-high confidence)
- If marked "Fiberglass coated steel, Single Wall" → Classify as "Single-Walled" (high confidence)
- Pre-1990 without qualifier → Classify as "Unknown" (need additional information)

#### 3. Brand Name Recognition

Alabama data contains several brand names that indicate construction type:

| Brand Name | Typical Construction | Classification |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **ACT-100** | Double-wall composite steel/FRP | Secondary Contained |
| **GLASTEEL / Glas Steel** | Double-wall composite | Secondary Contained |
| **TITAN / Titan Poly** | Usually double-wall | Secondary Contained (verify with date) |
| **PERMATANK** | Double-wall | Secondary Contained |
| **ELUTRON** | Double-wall | Secondary Contained |
| **STI-P3** | Cathodically protected single-wall steel | Single-Walled |

#### 4. Under-Dispenser Containment Tracking

While not directly related to tank classification, Alabama's **August 6, 2007** under-dispenser containment requirement creates an additional data point:

- Facilities with new dispensers installed after this date should have UDC
- This can serve as a cross-validation point for facility upgrade history
- May indicate broader facility upgrades including tank replacement

#### 5. Missing Installation Dates

**Alabama Data Pattern:** Some tanks may have missing installation dates.

**Approach:**
- If material = "Double Wall" → Classify as "Secondary Contained" (high confidence) regardless of date
- If material = "Single Wall" → Classify as "Single-Walled" (high confidence) regardless of date
- If material = "Steel" or "Fiberglass" without qualifier and no date → Classify as "Unknown" (low confidence)

#### 6. Multi-Compartment Tanks

Alabama data shows compartment designations (e.g., "8P/4D" = 8,000 gallon premium / 4,000 gallon diesel).

**Note:** Compartments within a single tank share the same construction type. The classification applies to the entire tank structure, not individual compartments.

#### 7. Geographic Considerations

**Alabama-Specific Factors:**
- **Coastal counties** (Mobile, Baldwin): May have more stringent local requirements or faster adoption of secondary containment due to environmental sensitivity
- **Military installations:** May have earlier adoption of double-wall systems per DoD requirements
- **Interstate corridors:** Commercial facilities may have upgraded earlier

### Expected Classification Distribution for Alabama

Based on Alabama's data patterns and regulatory timeline, expected distribution:

| Classification | Expected Percentage | Basis |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Single-Walled** | 60-70% | Large number of pre-2016 steel tanks, explicit "Single Wall" designations |
| **Secondary Contained** | 15-25% | Post-2016 installations, explicit "Double Wall," modern FRP and composite |
| **Unknown** | 10-15% | Missing data (NA), pre-1990 FRP without qualifiers, steel tanks without dates |

**Actual distribution will vary based on:**
- Installation date distribution in dataset
- Tank closure/removal patterns
- Data quality and completeness

### Data Quality Specific to Alabama

#### High-Quality Indicators:
1. ✅ Explicit "Single Wall" or "Double Wall" prefixes (found in ~17% of tanks)
2. ✅ Detailed compartment information suggests well-maintained database
3. ✅ Brand name information provides additional validation

#### Data Quality Challenges:
1. ⚠️ 71% of tanks marked simply as "Steel" without wall type qualifier
2. ⚠️ 2.6% marked as "NA" for material
3. ⚠️ Inconsistent notation (e.g., "DBW," "DBL WALL," "DBLWALL," "DBWALL" all mean double-wall)

#### Recommended Data Cleaning:
```r
# Standardize double-wall variations
cleaned_data <- alabama_data %>%
  mutate(
    material_standardized = case_when(
      str_detect(toupper(tank_construction_material), 
                 "DBW|DBL WALL|DBLWALL|DBWALL|DOUBLEWALL|DOUBLE WALL") ~ 
        "Double Wall",
      str_detect(toupper(tank_construction_material), "SINGLE WALL") ~ 
        "Single Wall",
      TRUE ~ tank_construction_material
    )
  )
```

### Alabama Implementation Summary

**Strengths:**
- Clear federal regulatory alignment (SPA approved September 14, 2021)
- Earlier under-dispenser containment requirement (August 6, 2007)
- Explicit wall-type designations in many records
- Well-defined delivery prohibition enforcement mechanism

**Implementation Notes:**
- Installation date is critical for classifying 71% of tanks marked simply as "Steel"
- Fiberglass-coated steel requires careful date-based interpretation
- Brand names provide valuable classification signals
- Missing data rate is manageable at ~2.6%

**Next Steps for Alabama Data:**
1. Validate installation date completeness and accuracy
2. Cross-reference with inspection records if available
3. Apply classification algorithm and review "Unknown" category
4. Conduct county-level analysis for geographic patterns
5. Generate summary statistics for ADEM reporting

## Tennessee Implementation

### Overview

Tennessee has implemented UST regulations that are **more stringent** than federal requirements, particularly regarding the secondary containment mandate date. Tennessee required secondary containment for all new tanks, piping, and motor fuel dispensers nearly a decade before the federal requirement.

**Implementing Agency:** Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), Division of Underground Storage Tanks  
**State Program Approval Status:** Approved State Program (SPA)  
**Original SPA Approval:** November 17, 1998 (effective January 15, 1999)  
**2015 Revisions Approval:** September 9, 2021 (86 FR 50470-50477)  
**Effective Date:** November 8, 2021  
**URL:** https://www.tn.gov/environment/ust.html

### Tennessee Regulatory Framework

#### State Statutes
**Tennessee Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Act of 1988**
- Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 68-215-101 to 68-215-204 (2018)

#### State Regulations
**Tennessee Compiled Rules and Regulations (Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs.) Chapter 0400-18-01**  
**Full Citation:** Underground Storage Tank Program  
**URL:** https://publications.tnsosfiles.com/rules/0400/0400-18/0400-18.htm

**Key Sections:**
- **0400-18-01-.01** - Program Scope, Definitions and Proprietary Information
- **0400-18-01-.02** - UST Systems: Installation and Operation
- **0400-18-01-.03** - UST Systems: Installation Certification
- **0400-18-01-.04** - Release Detection
- **0400-18-01-.07** - Out-of-Service UST Systems and Closure
- **0400-18-01-.16** - Operator Training

### Tennessee-Specific Requirements

#### 1. Secondary Containment Requirement - EARLIER THAN FEDERAL

**Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0400-18-01-.02(1)(c):**
> "All tanks, pressurized piping, suction piping that does not meet the requirements of subparts (2)(b)2.(i) through (iii) of Rule 0400-18-01-.04, and/or motor fuel dispensers installed on or after July 24, 2007, shall be secondarily contained in accordance with paragraph (2) of this rule."

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Tennessee Requirement:** July 24, 2007
- **Federal Requirement:** April 11, 2016
- **Difference:** Tennessee mandate is **8 years, 8 months** earlier than federal

**Components Required (Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0400-18-01-.02(2)):**
1. **Tanks:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring
2. **Pressurized Piping:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring
3. **Suction Piping:** Secondary containment if not meeting safe suction criteria
4. **Motor Fuel Dispensers:** Under-dispenser containment

#### 2. Replacement Trigger

**Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0400-18-01-.02(3):**
> "Tank owners and/or operators replacing any tanks, piping and/or motor fuel dispensers on or after July 24, 2007, shall comply with the following: (a) Tank owners and/or operators replacing any tanks, piping and/or motor fuel dispensers shall install secondary containment and interstitial monitoring..."

**Comparison to Federal:**
- Both Tennessee and federal require secondary containment for replacements
- Tennessee trigger date is July 24, 2007; federal is April 11, 2016
- Tennessee is **more restrictive** due to earlier effective date

#### 3. Repair Definition

**Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0400-18-01-.01 - "Repair" definition:**
> "In the context of replacement of piping on or after July 24, 2007, restoration of a portion of piping in lieu of replacement of an entire piping run authorized by the division in writing"

This provides a mechanism for partial piping repairs that do not trigger the full secondary containment requirement, but requires Division approval.

#### 4. Regional Fee Billing Cycles

Tennessee has different annual tank fee billing cycles by region:
- **East Tennessee:** July 1 through June 30
- **Middle Tennessee:** October 1 through September 30
- **West Tennessee:** January 1 through December 31

This is relevant for understanding when facilities may update registration information.

### Tennessee Data Structure

Based on the TDEC database diagnostic, the following field structure is observed:

#### Primary Data Fields

| Tennessee Field | Universal Concept | Data Type | Classification Role |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| `date_tank_installed` | Installation Date | Excel serial (numeric) | Primary date-based classification |
| `tank_construction` | Material Construction Type | Character | Primary material-based classification |
| `category_of_construction` | Wall Type Category | Character | Explicit single/double-wall indicator |
| `status` | Tank Status | Character | Filter for active vs. closed tanks |
| `compartment_id` | Tank/Compartment Identifier | Character | Unique unit identifier |
| `facility_id_ust` | Facility Identifier | Character | Facility-level grouping |

#### Tank Construction Field Distribution

**Frequency Distribution (N=60,282 compartments):**

| `tank_construction` Value | Count | Percentage | Classification |
|--------------------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| Steel | 35,684 | 59.2% | Single-Walled |
| Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic | 8,400 | 13.9% | Date-Dependent |
| Cathodically Protected Steel-StiP3 | 6,935 | 11.5% | Single-Walled |
| Composite - Steel w/FRP | 6,012 | 10.0% | Secondary Contained |
| Tank Construction Material Other or Unknown | 2,637 | 4.4% | Unknown |
| Polyethylene Tank Jacket | 485 | 0.8% | Secondary Contained |
| Concrete | 128 | 0.2% | Unknown |
| NA | 1 | <0.1% | Unknown |

#### Category of Construction Field Distribution

**Frequency Distribution (N=60,282 compartments):**

| `category_of_construction` Value | Count | Percentage |
|----------------------------------|-------|------------|
| NA (NULL) | 53,215 | 88.3% |
| Single Wall | 3,905 | 6.5% |
| Double Wall | 3,162 | 5.2% |

**Key Observation:** 88.3% of records have no explicit wall-type designation, requiring classification via `tank_construction` field and installation date.

### Tennessee Classification Algorithm

      IF installation_date >= January 1, 1990 (Excel: 32874):
         RETURN "Secondary Contained" (Medium-High Confidence)
         REASON: Industry standard post-1990 is double-wall FRP
      ELSE IF installation_date < January 1, 1990:
         RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
         REASON: Mix of single and double-wall FRP before 1990
      ELSE IF installation_date IS NULL:

      REASON: Basic steel construction without secondary containment indicator
      
   ELSE IF tank_construction = "Cathodically Protected Steel-StiP3":
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (High Confidence)
      REASON: STI-P3 is cathodically protected single-wall steel per 40 CFR 280.20(a)(2)

6. CONCRETE TANKS

   ELSE IF tank_construction = "Concrete":
      RETURN "Single-Walled" (Low Confidence)
      REASON: Concrete tanks comonly sw old forbidden builds; insufficient data for reliable classification

7. INSUFFICIENT DATA

   ELSE IF tank_construction = "Tank Construction Material Other or Unknown":
      RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
      REASON: Material type explicitly unknown
      
   ELSE IF tank_construction IS NULL:
      RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
      REASON: No construction information available
      
   ELSE:
      RETURN "Unknown" (Low Confidence)
      REASON: Classification cannot be determined from available data

END TENNESSEE CLASSIFICATION

### Tennessee Data Field Mapping

#### Tank Construction Type Mapping

| Tennessee `tank_construction` Value | Universal Classification | Confidence | Rationale |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|-----------|
| `Steel` | Single-Walled | High | Basic steel without secondary barrier |
| `Cathodically Protected Steel-StiP3` | Single-Walled | High | STI-P3 = single-wall with factory-applied CP |
| `Composite - Steel w/FRP` | Secondary Contained | High | Steel inner + FRP outer = double-wall |
| `Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic` | Date-Dependent | Medium-High | ≥1990: Secondary; <1990: Unknown |
| `Polyethylene Tank Jacket` | Secondary Contained | High | Jacket provides secondary barrier |
| `Concrete` | Unknown | Low | Rare; insufficient classification data |
| `Tank Construction Material Other or Unknown` | Unknown | Low | Explicitly unknown material |
| `NULL` | Unknown | Low | Missing data |

#### Category of Construction Mapping

| Tennessee `category_of_construction` Value | Universal Classification | Confidence |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| `Double Wall` | Secondary Contained | Very High |
| `Single Wall` | Single-Walled | Very High |
| `NULL` (53,215 records) | Use tank_construction field | — |

#### Date Format Conversion

Tennessee stores dates as Excel serial numbers. Key conversion values:

| Date | Excel Serial | Significance |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| July 24, 2007 | 39287 | Tennessee secondary containment requirement |
| January 1, 1990 | 32874 | FRP industry shift to double-wall |
| April 11, 2016 | 42470 | Federal secondary containment requirement |
| December 22, 1988 | 32499 | Federal UST regulations effective |

**R Conversion:**
```r
# Excel serial to R Date
excel_to_date <- function(excel_serial) {
  as.Date(as.numeric(excel_serial), origin = "1899-12-30")
}
```

# Validation Query 8: Missing installation dates
tn_classified %>%
  filter(is.na(install_date_numeric) | install_date_numeric == 0) %>%
  count(tank_construction, ust_classification)
```

### Tennessee-Specific Considerations

#### 1. High NULL Rate in `category_of_construction`

The diagnostic shows 53,215 of 60,282 compartments (88.3%) have NULL values for `category_of_construction`. This means the classification algorithm must rely primarily on:
- Installation date (if after July 24, 2007 → Secondary Contained)
- `tank_construction` material type

#### 2. Excel Serial Date Format

Tennessee stores `date_tank_installed` as Excel serial numbers (integers like 22767). Conversion formula:
```r
as.Date(as.numeric(excel_serial), origin = "1899-12-30")
```

**Important:** Validate that dates convert correctly before classification. Sample conversions:
- 22767 → 1962-05-07
- 39287 → 2007-07-24 (TN requirement date)
- 42470 → 2016-04-11 (Federal requirement date)

#### 3. STI-P3 Classification

"Cathodically Protected Steel-StiP3" refers to Steel Tank Institute P3 technology - factory-applied cathodic protection on single-wall steel tanks. This is **not** secondary containment despite having advanced corrosion protection. The diagnostic shows 6,935 tanks with this construction.

#### 4. Polyethylene Tank Jacket

The diagnostic shows 485 tanks with "Polyethylene Tank Jacket" construction. These should be classified as Secondary Contained because the polyethylene jacket serves as an outer barrier for leak containment.

#### 5. LUST Data Integration

Tennessee LUST data (`EnvSites`) contains 16,956 records with:
- Discovery dates in `MMM-DD-YYYY` format (e.g., "APR-05-1994")
- Status codes indicating case progression
- Can be linked via `facilityid` to tank data

#### 6. Reimbursement Fund Data

Tennessee has an active reimbursement fund (`ReimbSites` with 5,262 records). Facilities with fund claims may have more complete closure and remediation documentation.

#### 7. Geographic Considerations

Tennessee data uses standard county names (available in `EnvSites.facilitycounty`). The three regional fee billing cycles (East, Middle, West) may correlate with data quality patterns.

#### 8. EPA Merge Logic

The diagnostic shows EPA facility IDs follow format `TN[7-digit-id]`:
- Strip "TN" prefix from EPA IDs for matching
- Tennessee state IDs are numeric-only
- Match rate appears high (10/10 EPA samples found in TN data)

**Data source:** Tennessee TDEC UST Database (Diagnostic Report v2)  
**Regulatory authority:** Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0400-18-01 (2018)

Based on the diagnostic report and your code, I have researched the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission (APC&EC) Rule 12.

**CRITICAL CORRECTION FOR YOUR CODE:**
In your provided R script (`02_Clean_AR.R`), you have the following logic:
`double_walled = ifelse(dbl_wall == 1 | int_lining == 1, 1, 0)`

**This is incorrect per federal and state definition.** An internal lining (`UT_MOC_IntLiningTF`) is a corrosion protection upgrade applied to **Single-Walled** tanks (typically steel) to extend their life. It does *not* create a secondary containment barrier. I have corrected this in the logic below.

Here is the **Arkansas Implementation** section formatted for your schema document.

## Arkansas Implementation

### Overview

Arkansas regulates USTs through the Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Arkansas has adopted federal standards by reference but established an earlier deadline for secondary containment implementation compared to the 2015 federal rules.

**Implementing Agency:** Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment (DEQ), Office of Land Resources
**State Program Approval Status:** Approved State Program (SPA)
**Federal Register Approval:** February 26, 1990 (55 FR 6773); Revisions approved January 22, 2021 (86 FR 6573)
**URL:** [https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/rst/](https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/rst/)

### Arkansas Regulatory Framework

#### State Statutes

**Arkansas Code Annotated § 8-7-801 et seq.**

* Regulated Substance Storage Tanks

#### State Regulations

**APC&EC Rule 12**
**Full Citation:** Storage Tanks (Regulation No. 12)
**URL:** [https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/regs/files/reg12_final_2020.pdf](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.adeq.state.ar.us/regs/files/reg12_final_2020.pdf)

**Key Sections:**

* **Reg. 12.109** - Adoption of Federal Regulations
* **Reg. 12.502** - Secondary Containment Requirements
* **Reg. 12.504** - General Requirements (Dates)

### Arkansas-Specific Requirements

#### 1. Secondary Containment Requirement - EARLIER THAN FEDERAL

**APC&EC Rule 12, Reg. 12.504:**

> "(A) Each new underground storage tank... installed after **July 1, 2007**, shall be secondarily contained and monitored for leaks..."
> "(B) Any underground storage tank... replaced after **July 1, 2007**, shall be secondarily contained..."

**Critical Distinction:**

* **Arkansas Requirement:** July 1, 2007
* **Federal Requirement:** April 11, 2016
* **Difference:** Arkansas mandate is **8 years, 9 months** earlier than federal.

#### 2. Trust Fund Eligibility (Advisory)

Arkansas maintains a Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund. Data accuracy regarding tank construction is critical for fund eligibility. The dataset contains specific flags (e.g., `UT_MOC_*`) that are used to verify eligibility status.

### Arkansas-Specific Timeline

## Colorado Implementation

### Overview

Colorado has implemented UST regulations through the Division of Oil and Public Safety (OPS) that are **more stringent** than federal requirements, particularly regarding the secondary containment mandate date. Colorado required secondary containment for all new tanks and piping nearly eight years before the federal requirement.

**Implementing Agency:** Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE), Division of Oil and Public Safety (OPS)  
**State Program Approval Status:** Approved State Program (SPA)  
**Federal Register Approval:** May 20, 2019 (84 FR 22727-22733)  
**Effective Date:** July 19, 2019  
**State Regulations Effective:** January 1, 2017 (2015 federal revisions)  
**URL:** https://ops.colorado.gov/petroleum

### Colorado Regulatory Framework

#### State Statutes
**Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.) Title 8, Articles 20 and 20.5**
- C.R.S. § 8-20-101 et seq. - Oil Inspection Act
- C.R.S. § 8-20.5-101 et seq. - Petroleum Storage Tank Act

#### State Regulations
**7 Code of Colorado Regulations (CCR) 1101-14**  
**Full Citation:** Storage Tank Regulations  
**Current Version:** Effective March 17, 2019  
**URL:** https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=5570&fileName=7+CCR+1101-14

**Key Sections:**
- **7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-2-1** - Performance Standards for New UST Systems
- **7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-4-4** - Release Detection Requirements
- **7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-5-1** - Reporting and Investigation
- **7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-8-1** - Operator Training

### Colorado-Specific Requirements

#### 1. Secondary Containment Requirement - EARLIER THAN FEDERAL

**7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-2-1(a):**
> "Secondary containment and interstitial monitoring is required for all new underground tank installations."

**7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-2-1(b):**
> "Secondary containment and interstitial monitoring is required for all new piping installations, including piping to remote fills."

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **Original Colorado requirement:** August 1, 2008
- **Federal Requirement:** April 11, 2016
- **Difference:** Colorado mandate is **7 years, 8 months** earlier than federal

**Components Required (7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-2-1):**
1. **Tanks:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring
2. **Piping:** Double-walled with interstitial monitoring (all new installations)
3. **Interstitial Monitoring:** Must be used as primary release detection method
4. **Secondary Containment Testing:** Required at installation and approximately one year thereafter

#### 2. Piping Replacement Trigger

**7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-2-1(b):**
> "The secondary containment requirements for replaced piping are triggered when a minimum of **50% or 50 feet (whichever is less)** of the total length of piping connected to a single underground tank is replaced."

**Comparison to Federal:**
- **Colorado Trigger:** 50% or 50 feet (whichever is less)
- **Federal Trigger:** 50% of piping run
- **Colorado is MORE RESTRICTIVE** - the "50 feet" provision captures smaller piping systems

#### 3. Secondary Containment Testing Requirements

**Colorado-Specific Requirement (Effective 2008):**

All secondary containment systems must be tested:
- **Initial testing:** At time of installation
- **Follow-up testing:** Approximately one year after installation
- **Containment sump testing:** By January 1, 2020, and every three years thereafter

**7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-4-4(g) - Interstitial Monitoring:**
- Must document "normal" sensor status report for each tank monthly
- Monthly interstitial monitoring may be used in place of annual line testing if product piping is double-walled
- All UST systems installed during and after August 1, 2008 must use interstitial monitoring as primary release detection method

#### 4. Overfill Prevention Device Restrictions

**Effective January 1, 2017:**
- Ball float valves can no longer be used as primary overfill prevention device if malfunctioning
- Ball float valves cannot be primary overfill prevention device in new UST installations after January 1, 2017
- Alternative devices required: drop tube fill valve, audible alarm, etc.

### Colorado Data Structure

Based on the Colorado OPS database diagnostic, the following field structure is observed:

#### Primary Classification Fields

| Colorado Field | Universal Concept | Data Type | Classification Role |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| `installation_date` | Installation Date | Character (date) | Primary date-based classification |
| `tank_material` | Tank Construction Material | Character | Primary material-based classification |
| `tank_wall_type` | Explicit Wall Type | Character | **98.4% empty** - rarely populated |
| `tank_corrosion_protection_method` | Corrosion Protection Type | Character | Secondary indicator (CP = single-wall) |
| `piping_wall_type` | Piping Wall Construction | Character | Supplementary classification data |
| `tank_status` | Tank Status | Character | Filter for active vs. closed tanks |

#### Tank Material Field Distribution (N=51,529)

**Critical Observation:** The `tank_wall_type` field is 98.4% empty (50,690 of 51,529 records), making `tank_material` the primary classification field.

| `tank_material` Value | Count | Percentage | Classification Implication |
|----------------------|-------|------------|----------------------------|
| Asphalt Coated or Bare Steel | 14,385 | 27.9% | Single-Walled (requires upgrade analysis) |
| FRP: Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic | 7,027 | 13.6% | Date-dependent classification |
| NA (Missing) | 6,708 | 13.0% | Unknown |
| ST: Cathodically Protected Steel | 6,663 | 12.9% | Single-Walled |
| AST: UL142/Equiv. | 5,065 | 9.8% | Aboveground tank (excluded from UST analysis) |
| Unknown | 4,941 | 9.6% | Unknown |
| AST: UL2085/Equiv. (Protected) | 1,946 | 3.8% | Aboveground tank (excluded) |
| Not Listed | 1,227 | 2.4% | Unknown |
| COMP: Steel/FRP Composite | 771 | 1.5% | **Secondary Contained** |
| JKT: Jacketed Steel Tank | 760 | 1.5% | **Secondary Contained** |
| Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic | 715 | 1.4% | Date-dependent classification |
| Epoxy Coated Steel | 369 | 0.7% | Single-Walled |

#### Explicit Wall Type Cases (Where Populated, N=839)

Among the 1.6% of records with `tank_wall_type` populated:

| `tank_material` | `tank_wall_type` | Count | Agreement |
|----------------|------------------|-------|-----------|
| UL142/Equiv. | Double-Walled | 264 | ✓ AST double-wall |
| UL2085/Equiv. (Protected) | Double-Walled | 162 | ✓ Protected AST |
| Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic | Double-Walled | 83 | ✓ Modern FRP |
| ST: Cathodically Protected Steel | Single-Walled | 27 | ✓ CP steel is single-wall |
| FRP: Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic | Double-Walled | 49 | ✓ Modern FRP |

**Validation:** Where `tank_wall_type` is populated, it shows high agreement with material-based inferences.

#### Composite and Jacketed Tank Analysis

**COMP: Steel/FRP Composite (N=771):**
- 588 records with "Steel/Fiberglass Composite" corrosion protection method
- 7 explicitly marked as "Double-Walled" in `tank_wall_type`
- Installation era: Pre-1990 (137), 1990-1999 (179), 2000-2009 (385), 2010+ (49)

**JKT: Jacketed Steel Tank (N=760):**
- 650 records with "Jacketed Steel Tank" corrosion protection method
- 4 explicitly marked as "Double-Walled" in `tank_wall_type`
- Jacketed tanks provide secondary containment via outer jacket

#### STI-P3 Analysis

**Cathodically Protected Steel with STI-P3 (N=1,993):**
- STI-P3 is Steel Tank Institute standard for factory-applied cathodic protection
- 100% are **Single-Walled** steel tanks with corrosion protection
- This is NOT secondary containment

**Cross-reference from `tank_corrosion_protection_method` = "STI-P3" (N=2,098):**
- 1,993 linked to "ST: Cathodically Protected Steel"
- 84 linked to "Epoxy Coated Steel"
- 7 linked to "Asphalt Coated or Bare Steel"

#### Installation Date Distribution

**By Regulatory Era (N=39,230 with valid dates):**

| Era | Count | Percentage | Expected Classification |
|-----|-------|------------|------------------------|
| Pre-1988 | 21,635 | 55.1% | Mostly Single-Walled |
| 1988-1999 | 8,865 | 22.6% | Single-Walled (with CP) |
| 2000-2006 | 3,178 | 8.1% | Single-Walled |
| 2007-2009 | 1,311 | 3.3% | Mixed (CO req starts Aug 2008) |
| 2010-2015 | 1,666 | 4.2% | Secondary Contained (post-CO req) |
| 2016+ | 2,575 | 6.6% | Secondary Contained (federal req) |

**Missing installation dates:** 12,299 records (23.9%)

#### Active Tank Analysis (Currently In Use, N=16,568)

| `tank_material` | Count | Classification Expectation |
|----------------|-------|---------------------------|
| FRP: Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic | 4,534 | Date-dependent (likely Secondary if post-1990) |
| AST: UL142/Equiv. | 3,315 | Aboveground (exclude) |
| ST: Cathodically Protected Steel | 2,661 | Single-Walled |
| NA | 2,058 | Unknown |
| AST: UL2085/Equiv. (Protected) | 1,393 | Aboveground (exclude) |
| JKT: Jacketed Steel Tank | 578 | Secondary Contained |
| COMP: Steel/FRP Composite | 542 | Secondary Contained |

**Wall Type for Active Tanks:**
- NA: 15,869 (95.8%)
- Double-Walled: 584 (3.5%)

### Colorado-Specific Considerations

#### 1. High Proportion of Aboveground Storage Tanks (ASTs)

**Challenge:** 7,011 tanks (13.6%) are marked with "AST:" prefix in `tank_material` field.

**Categories:**
- AST: UL142/Equiv.: 5,065 tanks
- AST: UL2085/Equiv. (Protected): 1,946 tanks
- AST: UL2080/Equiv. (Fire Resistant): 170 tanks
- AST: SwRI (Fire Tested): 15 tanks
- AST: API 12-F: 8 tanks

**Approach:**
- Filter these out with `ust_classification = "Excluded_AST"` before UST analysis
- These are governed by different regulations (not 40 CFR 280)
- Maintain separate AST inventory for completeness

#### 2. Empty `tank_wall_type` Field (98.4% Missing)

**Challenge:** Only 839 of 51,529 records (1.6%) have `tank_wall_type` populated.

**Implication:**
- Cannot rely on `tank_wall_type` for classification
- Must use `tank_material` as primary indicator
- Installation date becomes critical for date-dependent classifications
- `tank_corrosion_protection_method` provides secondary validation

**Validation Evidence:** Where `tank_wall_type` IS populated, it shows high agreement with material-based inferences.

#### 3. STI-P3 Cathodically Protected Steel

**Colorado Pattern:** 6,663 tanks marked as "ST: Cathodically Protected Steel" + 2,098 with "STI-P3" in corrosion protection method.

**Critical Distinction:**
- STI-P3 = Steel Tank Institute Specification P3
- Factory-applied cathodic protection on **single-walled** steel tanks
- Provides excellent corrosion resistance but is NOT secondary containment
- Classification: **Single-Walled** (high confidence)

**Reference:** 40 CFR 280.20(a)(2) - Cathodically protected steel tanks are single-walled tanks that meet corrosion protection standards.

#### 4. Composite and Jacketed Tank Reliability

**High Confidence Indicators:**
- "COMP: Steel/FRP Composite" (771 tanks) → Secondary Contained
- "JKT: Jacketed Steel Tank" (760 tanks) → Secondary Contained

**Cross-validation:**
- Where `tank_wall_type` is populated, 100% agreement:
  - COMP tanks with wall_type: 11 double-walled, 3 single-walled (investigate the 3)
  - JKT tanks with wall_type: 8 double-walled, 0 single-walled

**Industry Standards:**
- Composite tanks have steel inner tank + FRP outer shell = inherent double-wall
- Jacketed tanks have outer steel jacket = secondary containment barrier

#### 5. Fiberglass Installation Era Analysis

**1990 Cutoff Rationale:**
- Pre-1990: 2,579 FRP tanks (mixed single/double-wall era)
- 1990-1999: 1,817 FRP tanks (transition to double-wall standard)
- 2000-2009: 993 FRP tanks (predominantly double-wall)
- 2010+: 1,463 FRP tanks (nearly all double-wall)

**Classification Approach:**
- ≥1990: Secondary Contained (medium-high confidence)
- <1990: Unknown (low confidence - need additional data)

#### 6. Asphalt Coated or Bare Steel (27.9% of dataset)

**Challenge:** 14,385 tanks marked as "Asphalt Coated or Bare Steel" - the single largest category.

**Analysis:**
- 14,154 have no corrosion protection method listed
- 78 have "Impressed Current" CP
- 46 have "Internally Lined with Impressed Current"
- 39 have "Internally Lined"

**Classification:**
- All are **Single-Walled** (high confidence)
- Many likely pre-1988 installations that may or may not have been upgraded
- Those with CP/lining upgrades are compliant single-walled tanks

#### 7. Installation Date Completeness

**Data Quality:**
- Valid dates: 39,230 (76.1%)
- Missing dates: 12,299 (23.9%)

**Impact on Classification:**
- Missing dates prevent date-based secondary containment determination
- For tanks with explicit material indicators (COMP, JKT, STI-P3), missing dates are less critical
- For FRP and unknown materials, missing dates → "Unknown" classification

#### 8. Pre-1988 Tank Population (55.1%)

**Pattern:** 21,635 tanks installed before December 22, 1988.

**Regulatory Context:**
- Not originally required to have corrosion protection or release detection
- Must have been upgraded by December 22, 1998 (40 CFR 280.21)
- Vast majority are single-walled tanks with upgrades

**Expected Classification:**
- Predominantly "Single-Walled" (with CP or lining upgrades)
- Some may be "Unknown" if upgrade documentation missing

#### 9. Colorado's 2008-2016 Installation Window

**Critical Period:** 1,311 tanks installed between Aug 1, 2008 and Apr 11, 2016.

**Significance:**
- Subject to Colorado's secondary containment requirement (7 CCR 1101-14 § 2-2-1)
- NOT subject to federal requirement (which started Apr 11, 2016)
- All should be classified as "Secondary Contained" (very high confidence)

**Validation Check:**
```r
co_classified %>%
  filter(install_date_parsed >= as.Date("2008-08-01"),
         install_date_parsed < as.Date("2016-04-11")) %>%
  count(ust_classification)
# Expected: 100% Secondary_Contained
```

#### 10. Petroleum Storage Tank Fund Considerations

**Context:** Colorado maintains a Petroleum Storage Tank Fund for reimbursement of cleanup costs and compliance incentives.

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fund applications require accurate tank construction documentation
- Misclassification could affect reimbursement eligibility
- Records should be kept indefinitely for potential fund claims

**Classification Impact:**
- High-quality classification supports accurate fund eligibility determination
- "Unknown" classifications may require additional documentation for fund applications

### Expected Classification Distribution for Colorado

Based on Colorado's data patterns, regulatory timeline, and diagnostic results:

| Classification | Expected Percentage | Basis |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Single-Walled** | 45-55% | Large pre-2008 population (especially pre-1988), STI-P3, bare/asphalt steel |
| **Secondary Contained** | 20-30% | Post-2008 installations, COMP/JKT, modern FRP, explicit double-wall |
| **Unknown** | 20-25% | Missing dates (23.9%), pre-1990 FRP without dates, "Unknown"/"Not Listed" material |
| **Excluded_AST** | 13-14% | Aboveground tanks (filtered out of UST analysis) |

**Active Tanks Only (Currently In Use, N=16,568):**
- Expected higher percentage of Secondary Contained (newer tanks still in service)
- Expected lower percentage of Unknown (better documentation for active tanks)

### Data Quality Specific to Colorado

#### High-Quality Indicators:
1. ✅ 76.1% of records have valid installation dates
2. ✅ Clear material designations (COMP, JKT, STI-P3, FRP) in most records
3. ✅ Separate corrosion protection method field provides validation
4. ✅ Explicit AST designation allows clean filtering

#### Data Quality Challenges:
1. ⚠️ 98.4% of records missing `tank_wall_type` (must rely on material field)
2. ⚠️ 23.9% missing installation dates
3. ⚠️ 27.9% marked as generic "Asphalt Coated or Bare Steel" without specificity
4. ⚠️ 13.0% marked as "NA" or "Unknown" in tank_material

#### Recommended Data Quality Improvements:
1. **Prioritize capturing installation dates** for records missing this critical field
2. **Cross-reference with inspection records** to validate material classifications
3. **Request explicit wall-type designation** during future inspections/upgrades
4. **Document upgrade dates** for pre-1988 tanks to confirm compliance status

### Colorado Implementation Summary

**Strengths:**
- **Earliest secondary containment requirement** (Aug 1, 2008 - 7.7 years before federal)
- **Strong SPA status** (approved July 19, 2019)
- **Clear material designations** (COMP, JKT, STI-P3) in most records
- **Robust regulatory framework** (7 CCR 1101-14)
- **Comprehensive release database** (16,879 petroleum releases with 83.2% linked to tank data)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Installation date is critical for 76.1% of tanks
- Material field provides primary classification basis (wall_type field rarely populated)
- STI-P3 designation clearly indicates single-walled steel with CP
- Composite and jacketed tanks are reliably secondary contained
- AST population (13.6%) should be filtered out before UST analysis

**Regulatory Compliance Emphasis:**
- Colorado's August 1, 2008 requirement predates federal by nearly 8 years
- Interstitial monitoring mandatory for all post-2008 installations
- Secondary containment testing required at installation and one year thereafter
- Three-year containment sump testing requirement (by Jan 1, 2020)

**Next Steps for Colorado Data:**
1. Apply classification algorithm to full dataset
2. Validate results using provided validation queries
3. Cross-reference with petroleum releases data for release pattern analysis
4. Generate county-level summaries for geographic patterns
5. Identify tanks with missing critical data for follow-up documentation

## Data Quality Guidelines

### Essential Data Fields

For accurate classification, the following fields are essential:

#### Required Fields
1. **Installation Date** - Must be present and accurate
2. **Tank Material/Construction Type** - At least one material indicator
3. **Tank Status** - Active, Removed, Closed, etc.

#### Highly Recommended Fields
4. **Replacement Date** - If tank was replaced
5. **Upgrade Dates** - CP installation, internal lining, etc.
6. **Double-Wall Indicator** - Explicit flag if available
7. **Capacity** - Helps identify potential errors
8. **Substance Stored** - Petroleum vs. hazardous substance

#### Optional but Valuable Fields
9. **Operator/Owner Information** - For compliance tracking
10. **Inspection History** - Helps validate classification
11. **Geographic Coordinates** - Spatial analysis
12. **Facility Type** - Gas station, airport, government, etc.

### Data Quality Checks

#### Check 1: Date Validity
```r
# Check for impossible or suspicious dates
data %>%
  filter(install_date < as.Date("1930-01-01") | 
         install_date > Sys.Date()) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Dates before 1930 or in the future are likely data entry errors.

#### Check 2: Classification-Date Consistency
```r
# Check for tanks classified as single-walled but installed after secondary requirement
data %>%
  filter(install_date >= state_secondary_req_date,
         classification == "Single_Walled") %>%
  select(tank_id, install_date, classification, all_material_fields)
```

**Issue:** Should be very rare unless tank has specific exemption.

#### Check 3: Upgrade-Material Consistency
```r
# Check for CP upgrade dates on fiberglass tanks (impossible)
data %>%
  filter(material == "Fiberglass",
         !is.na(cp_upgrade_date)) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Cathodic protection only applies to steel tanks.

#### Check 4: Status-Date Consistency
```r
# Check for removed tanks with future dates
data %>%
  filter(status == "Removed",
         removed_date > Sys.Date()) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Cannot remove tanks in the future.

#### Check 5: Conflicting Material Indicators
```r
# Check for tanks marked as both single and double-walled
data %>%
  filter(double_walled == "Y",
         (asphalt_steel == "Y" | bare_steel == "Y")) %>%
  count()
```

**Issue:** Conflicting indicators suggest data quality problem.

### Handling Missing Data

| Field Missing | Classification Impact | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Installation Date** | High - Cannot apply date-based rules | Flag as "Unknown" unless other strong indicators |
| **Material Type** | High - Core classification factor | Flag as "Unknown" |
| **Upgrade Dates** | Medium - May misclassify upgraded single-wall | Assume no upgrade; may undercount single-walled |
| **Status** | Medium - May include inactive tanks | Filter for active tanks only |
| **Capacity** | Low - Not used in classification | No impact |

### Imputation Strategies (Use with Caution)

#### Strategy 1: Installation Date from Facility Records
```r
# If tank install date missing but facility has other tanks with dates
data %>%
  group_by(facility_id) %>%
  mutate(imputed_install_date = if_else(
    is.na(install_date),
    median(install_date, na.rm = TRUE),
    install_date
  ))
```

**Caution:** Only use if tanks at same facility likely installed together.

#### Strategy 2: Material from Similar Tanks
```r
# If material missing, use most common material for tanks of similar capacity/era
data %>%
  mutate(capacity_bin = cut(capacity, breaks = c(0, 500, 1000, 2000, Inf)),
         year_bin = cut(year(install_date), breaks = c(0, 1988, 2000, 2010, Inf))) %>%
  group_by(capacity_bin, year_bin) %>%
  mutate(imputed_material = if_else(
    is.na(material),
    names(which.max(table(material))),
    material
  ))
```

**Caution:** Only use for exploratory analysis; document imputation clearly.

## Validation Framework

### Classification Validation Metrics

#### Metric 1: Distribution Reasonableness

**Expected Pattern:**
```
Pre-1988 installations: Mostly Single-Walled (with some unknowns)
1988-2008: Mostly Single-Walled
Post-2008 (or post-state requirement): Mostly Secondary Contained
Post-2016: Almost entirely Secondary Contained
```

**R Code:**
```r
data %>%
  mutate(era = case_when(
    install_date < as.Date("1988-12-22") ~ "Pre-1988",
    install_date < as.Date("2008-12-20") ~ "1988-2008",
    install_date < as.Date("2016-04-11") ~ "2008-2016",
    TRUE ~ "Post-2016"
  )) %>%
  count(era, classification) %>%
  group_by(era) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = classification, values_from = c(n, percentage))
```

#### Metric 2: Confidence Distribution

**Expected Pattern:**
```
High + Very High confidence: >70% of classifications
Medium confidence: 15-25%
Low confidence: <15%
```

**R Code:**
```r
data %>%
  count(classification_confidence) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100)
```

#### Metric 3: Unknown Rate

**Target:** <10% of active tanks classified as "Unknown"

**R Code:**
```r
data %>%
  filter(status == "Active") %>%
  summarize(
    total = n(),
    unknown = sum(classification == "Unknown"),
    unknown_rate = unknown / total * 100
  )
```

#### Metric 4: Cross-Validation with Inspections

If inspection data available:
```r
# Compare classifications with inspector observations
data %>%
  inner_join(inspection_data, by = "tank_id") %>%
  count(classification, inspector_noted_double_wall) %>%
  # Expect high agreement
  mutate(agreement = (classification == "Secondary_Contained" & 
                      inspector_noted_double_wall == "Yes") |
                     (classification == "Single_Walled" & 
                      inspector_noted_double_wall == "No"))
```

### Outlier Detection

#### Outlier 1: Post-2016 Single-Walled Tanks
```r
# Should be rare or non-existent
data %>%
  filter(install_date >= as.Date("2016-04-11"),
         classification == "Single_Walled") %>%
  select(facility_name, tank_id, install_date, material, 
         classification, classification_citation)
```

**Expected Result:** Empty or very few records (exemptions only)

#### Outlier 2: Pre-1990 Secondary Contained Tanks
```r
# Uncommon but possible (early adopters)
data %>%
  filter(install_date < as.Date("1990-01-01"),
         classification == "Secondary_Contained") %>%
  count(material, year = year(install_date))
```

**Expected Result:** Small number, primarily newer materials or special facilities

#### Outlier 3: Tanks with Upgrade Dates After Installation Date + 30 years
```r
# Likely data entry error or remarkable longevity
data %>%
  filter(!is.na(cp_upgrade_date),
         !is.na(install_date),
         cp_upgrade_date - install_date > 365 * 30) %>%
  select(facility_name, tank_id, install_date, cp_upgrade_date,
         age_at_upgrade = (cp_upgrade_date - install_date) / 365)
```

**Expected Result:** Few records; tanks >30 years at upgrade time are rare

### State Comparison Analysis

When multiple states are implemented:
```r
# Compare secondary containment rates across states
all_states_data %>%
  filter(status == "Active",
         install_date >= as.Date("2000-01-01")) %>%
  group_by(state, classification) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(percentage = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = classification, values_from = percentage)
```

**Expected Pattern:** States with earlier secondary containment requirements should show higher percentages of secondary contained tanks.

# APPENDIX B: State Program Approval (SPA) Status

## Overview of State Program Approval

Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal Act allows state UST programs approved by EPA to operate in lieu of the federal program. The state program approval (SPA) regulations set criteria for states to obtain the authority to operate in lieu of the federal program. State programs must be at least as stringent as EPA's.

## SPA Status by State (as of January 2026)

**Note:** All 50 states plus DC and territories have UST programs. SPA status refers to EPA approval to operate *in lieu of* federal program.

### States WITH State Program Approval (SPA)
*These states' programs operate instead of the federal program*

### States WITHOUT State Program Approval
*Federal and state requirements both apply*

| State/Territory | Implementing Agency | Federal + State Requirements |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Alaska | Dept of Environmental Conservation | Both apply |
| Arizona | Dept of Environmental Quality | Both apply |
| California | State Water Resources Control Board | Both apply |
| Michigan | Bureau of Fire Services | Both apply |
| New Jersey | Dept of Environmental Protection | Both apply |
| New York | Dept of Environmental Conservation | Both apply |
| American Samoa | EPA Region 9 | Federal applies |
| Guam | EPA Region 9 | Federal applies |
| Northern Mariana Islands | EPA Region 9 | Federal applies |
| US Virgin Islands | EPA Region 2 | Federal applies |

**Important Note:** While both federal and state regulations apply in states without SPA, the state regulations are generally just as stringent as, and oftentimes significantly more stringent than, EPA's regulations.

### Indian Country
**All Indian country:** Federal UST regulations apply directly (EPA enforcement). State regulations do NOT apply on tribal lands unless specifically adopted by the tribe.

## Implications for Data Classification

### For SPA States:
- Follow state-specific requirements in classification algorithm
- State regulatory dates take precedence over federal dates if more stringent
- Citation should reference state regulations

### For Non-SPA States:
- Must comply with BOTH federal and state requirements
- Use whichever requirement is more stringent
- Classification may require checking both sets of regulations

# APPENDIX C: Glossary

## Technical Terms

**Automatic Tank Gauging (ATG):** Electronic monitoring system that measures product level and can detect leaks through inventory reconciliation.

- **Sacrificial Anode:** Uses more reactive metal that corrodes instead of tank

**Composite Tank:** Tank constructed of multiple materials, typically steel inner wall with fiberglass outer wall, providing secondary containment.

**Dispenser:** Equipment that dispenses petroleum from a UST system, typically a gas pump.

**Double-Walled:** Construction with two complete walls separated by an interstitial space that can be monitored for leaks.

**Excavation Zone Liner:** Synthetic or concrete barrier placed in excavation around tank to provide secondary containment.

**Field-Constructed Tank:** UST assembled on-site rather than manufactured in a factory. Common for very large tanks.

**Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic (FRP):** Non-corrosive material made of fiberglass and resin, commonly used for modern UST construction.

**Hazardous Substance:** As defined by CERCLA § 101(14), any substance designated under Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, CERCLA, or listed as hazardous waste under RCRA. Distinguished from petroleum.

**Impressed Current:** Type of cathodic protection using external electrical power source to protect tank from corrosion.

**Interstitial Monitoring:** Continuous or periodic monitoring of the space between double walls to detect leaks from primary containment.

**Interstitial Space:** The physical gap between inner and outer walls of a double-walled tank or piping, monitored for leaks.

**Internal Lining:** Protective coating applied to interior of steel tanks to prevent corrosion from product contact.

**Jacketed Tank:** Primary tank surrounded by an outer jacket, similar to double-walled but may have different construction standards.

**Leak Detection:** General term for methods to discover releases, including monitoring wells, tank tightness testing, inventory reconciliation, etc.

**Operator Training:** EPA requirement (40 CFR § 280.242-245) for three classes of trained operators (A, B, C) at each facility.

**Overfill Prevention:** Equipment (automatic shutoff, flow restrictors, high-level alarms) that prevents tank overfilling during delivery.

**Petroleum:** Defined in 40 CFR § 280.12 as petroleum-based substances including crude oil, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, heating oil, and petroleum-based solvents. Excludes animal or vegetable oils.

**Piping:** Underground lines that convey petroleum from UST to dispenser or other equipment. Divided into:
- **Pressurized Piping:** Under pressure when product flows
- **Suction Piping:** Under suction when product flows

**Primary Containment:** The first barrier that directly holds the regulated substance.

**Release:** Any spilling, leaking, emitting, discharging, escaping, leaching, or disposing from a UST into groundwater, surface water, or subsurface soils.

**Release Detection:** Methods required by 40 CFR § 280.40-45 to determine if product has been released from the UST system.

**Sacrificial Anode:** Type of cathodic protection using a more reactive metal (zinc, magnesium) that corrodes preferentially, protecting the steel tank.

**Secondary Containment:** Complete dual-barrier system with interstitial monitoring that contains and detects releases before environmental impact.

**Spill Prevention:** Equipment (catch basins, spill buckets) that captures drips and spills when delivery hose is disconnected from fill pipe.

**State Program Approval (SPA):** EPA approval allowing a state program to operate in lieu of the federal program (must be "no less stringent").

**Steel-Tank Institute (STI):** Organization that develops standards for steel UST manufacturing, particularly STI-P3 standard.

**Subtitle I:** The portion of RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) that governs UST systems. Found at 42 U.S.C. § 6991 et seq.

**Sump:** Secondary containment area, typically at tank top, piping connections, or under dispensers, designed to capture small releases.
