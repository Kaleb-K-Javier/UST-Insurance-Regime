Lat/Long and EPA merge diagnostics thoughs

1) how well does EPA lat/long data do in total by state
2) how well does it do by state by first year of faciliyt observed?
3) those two help us understand how well we can do by merging
4) then we need to figure out for my 12 states how to propely merge to epa if the cleaning script does not have lat long completley 
Code\Cleaning\01_Clean_AR.R
Code\Cleaning\02_Clean_LA.R
Code\Cleaning\03_Clean_ME.R
Code\Cleaning\04_Clean_MI.R
Code\Cleaning\05_Clean_NJ.R
Code\Cleaning\06_Clean_NM.R
Code\Cleaning\07_Clean_OK.R
Code\Cleaning\08_Clean_TX.R
Code\Cleaning\10_Clean_AL.R
Code\Cleaning\11_Clean_TN.R
Code\Cleaning\13_Clean_CO.R
Code\Cleaning\14_Clean_PA.r
5) review the githup repo for the cleaning sciprts above and help start figuring out the measures of how well we can do and then help me figuer out how to properly merge on from the epa data
to facilites that are missing LAt/Long in the cleaning scripts
6) then for the non-cleaning script states we still want to know the missingess of lat/long in epa but we also really want to know 
the the missngesee from 1985 to 2023
